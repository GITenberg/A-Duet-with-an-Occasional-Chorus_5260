<p><span class="smcap">Dear Maude</span>,&mdash;All the little
two-oared boats which put out into the great ocean have need of
some chart which will show them how to lay their course.&nbsp;
Each starts full of happiness and confidence, and yet we know how
many founder, for it is no easy voyage, and there are rocks and
sandbanks upon the way.&nbsp; So I give a few pages of your own
private log, which tell of days of peace, and days of
storm&mdash;such storms as seem very petty from the deck of a
high ship, but are serious for the two-oared boats.&nbsp; If your
peace should help another to peace, or your storm console another
who is storm-tossed, then I know that you will feel repaid for
this intrusion upon your privacy.&nbsp; May all your voyage be
like the outset, and when at last the oars fall from your hands,
and those of Frank, may other loving ones be ready to take their
turn of toil&mdash;and so, <i>bon voyage</i>!</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE
OVERTURE<br />
I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ABOUT THAT DATE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> are the beginnings of some of
the letters which they wrote about that time.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Woking</i>, <i>May</i>
20<i>th</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Maude</span>,&mdash;You know
that your mother suggested, and we agreed, that we should be
married about the beginning of September.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
think that we might say the 3rd of August?&nbsp; It is a
Wednesday, and in every sense suitable.&nbsp; Do try to change
the date, for it would in many ways be preferable to the
other.&nbsp; I shall be eager to hear from you about it.&nbsp;
And now, dearest Maude . . . (The rest is irrelevant.)</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>St. Albans</i>, <i>May</i>
22<i>nd</i>.</p>
<p>My Dearest Frank,&mdash;Mother sees no objection to the 3rd of
August, and I am ready to do anything which will please you and
her.&nbsp; Of course there are the guests to be considered, and
the dressmakers and other arrangements, but I have no doubt that
we shall be able to change the date all right.&nbsp; O Frank . .
. (What follows is beside the point.)</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Woking</i>, <i>May</i>
25<i>th</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Maude</span>,&mdash;I have been
thinking over that change of date, and I see one objection which
had not occurred to me when I suggested it.&nbsp; August the 1st
is Bank holiday, and travelling is not very pleasant about that
time.&nbsp; My idea now is that we should bring it off before
that date.&nbsp; Fancy, for example, how unpleasant it would be
for your Uncle Joseph if he had to travel all the way from
Edinburgh with a Bank-holiday crowd.&nbsp; It would be selfish of
us if we did not fit in our plans so as to save our relatives
from inconvenience.&nbsp; I think therefore, taking everything
into consideration, that the 20th of July, a Wednesday, would be
the very best day that we could select.&nbsp; I do hope that you
will strain every nerve, my darling, to get your mother to
consent to this change.&nbsp; When I think . . . (A digression
follows.)</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>St. Albans</i>, <i>May</i>
27<i>th</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Frank</span>,&mdash;I think
that what you say about the date is very reasonable, and it is so
sweet and unselfish of you to think about Uncle Joseph.&nbsp; Of
course it would be very unpleasant for him to have to travel at
such a time, and we must strain every nerve to prevent it.&nbsp;
There is only one serious objection which my mother can
see.&nbsp; Uncle Percival (that is my mother&rsquo;s second
brother) comes back from Rangoon about the end of July, and will
miss the wedding (O Frank, think of its being <i>our</i>
wedding!) unless we delay it.&nbsp; He has always been very fond
of me, and he might be hurt if we were married so immediately
before his arrival.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think it would be as
well to wait?&nbsp; Mother leaves it all in your hands, and we
shall do exactly as you advise.&nbsp; O Frank . . . (The rest is
confidential.)</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Woking</i>, <i>May</i>
29<i>th</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My own Dearest</span>,&mdash;I think that
it would be unreasonable upon the part of your Uncle Percival to
think that we ought to have changed the date of a matter so
important to ourselves, simply in order that he should be
present.&nbsp; I am sure that on second thoughts your mother and
yourself will see the thing in this light.&nbsp; I must say,
however, that in one point I think you both show great
judgment.&nbsp; It would certainly be invidious to be married
<i>immediately</i> before his arrival.&nbsp; I really think that
he would have some cause for complaint if we did that.&nbsp; To
prevent any chance of hurting his feelings, I think that it would
be far best, if your mother and you agree with me, that we should
be married upon July 7th.&nbsp; I see that it is a Thursday, and
in every way suitable.&nbsp; When I read your last letter . . .
(The remainder is unimportant.)</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>St. Albans</i>, <i>June</i>
1<i>st</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Frank</span>,&mdash;I am sure that
you are right in thinking that it would be as well not to have
the ceremony too near the date of Uncle Percival&rsquo;s arrival
in England.&nbsp; We should be so sorry to hurt his feelings in
any way.&nbsp; Mother has been down to Madame Mortimer&rsquo;s
about the dresses, and she thinks that everything could be
hurried up so as to be ready by July 7th.&nbsp; She is so
obliging, and her skirts <i>do</i> hang so beautifully.&nbsp; O
Frank, it is only a few weeks&rsquo; time, and then . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Woking</i>, <i>June</i>
3<i>rd</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My own darling Maude</span>,&mdash;How
good you are&mdash;and your mother also&mdash;in falling in with
my suggestions!&nbsp; Please, please don&rsquo;t bother your dear
self about dresses.&nbsp; You only want the one travelling-dress
to be married in, and the rest we can pick up as we go.&nbsp; I
am sure that white dress with the black stripe&mdash;the one you
were playing tennis with at the Arlingtons&rsquo;&mdash;would do
splendidly.&nbsp; You looked simply splendid that day.&nbsp; I am
inclined to think that it is my favourite of all your dresses,
with the exception of the dark one with the light-green
front.&nbsp; That shows off your figure so splendidly.&nbsp; I am
very fond also of the grey Quaker-like alpaca dress.&nbsp; What a
little dove you do look in it!&nbsp; I think those dresses, and
of course your satin evening-dress, are my favourites.&nbsp; On
second thoughts, they are the only dresses I have ever seen you
in.&nbsp; But I like the grey best, because you wore it the first
time I ever&mdash;you remember!&nbsp; You must <i>never</i> get
rid of those dresses.&nbsp; They are too full of
associations.&nbsp; I want to see you in them for years, and
years, and years.</p>
<p>What I wanted to say was that you have so many charming
dresses, that we may consider ourselves independent of Madame
Mortimer.&nbsp; If her things should be late, they will come in
very usefully afterwards.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to be selfish
or inconsiderate, my own dearest girlie, but it would be rather
too much if we allowed my tailor or your dressmaker to be
obstacles to our union.&nbsp; I just want you&mdash;your dainty
little self&mdash;if you had only your &lsquo;wee coatie,&rsquo;
as Burns says.&nbsp; Now look here!&nbsp; I want you to bring
your influence to bear upon your mother, and so make a small
change in our plans.&nbsp; The earlier we can have our honeymoon,
the more pleasant the hotels will be.&nbsp; I do want your first
experiences with me to be without a shadow of discomfort.&nbsp;
In July half the world starts for its holiday.&nbsp; If we could
get away at the end of this mouth, we should just be ahead of
them.&nbsp; This month, this very month!&nbsp; Oh, do try to
manage this, my own dearest girl.&nbsp; The 30th of June is a
Tuesday, and in every way suitable.&nbsp; They could spare me
from the office most excellently.&nbsp; This would just give us
time to have the banns three times, beginning with next
Sunday.&nbsp; I leave it in your hands, dear.&nbsp; Do try to
work it.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>St. Albans</i>, <i>June</i>
4<i>th</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Frank</span>,&mdash;We nearly
called in the doctor after your dear old preposterous
letter.&nbsp; My mother gasped upon the sofa while I read her
some extracts.&nbsp; That I, the daughter of the house, should be
married in my old black and white tennis-dress, which I wore at
the Arlingtons&rsquo; to save my nice one!&nbsp; Oh, you are
simply splendid sometimes!&nbsp; And the learned way in which you
alluded to my alpaca.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, it&rsquo;s a
merino, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; Fancy your
remembering my wardrobe like that!&nbsp; And wanting me to wear
them all for years!&nbsp; So I shall, dear, secretly, when we are
quite quite alone.&nbsp; But they are all out of date already,
and if in a year or so you saw your poor dowdy wife with tight
sleeves among a roomful of puff-shouldered young ladies, you
would not be consoled even by the memory that it was in that
dress that you first . . . you know!</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I <i>must</i> have my dress to be married
in.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think mother would regard it as a legal
marriage if I hadn&rsquo;t, and if you knew how nice it will be,
you would not have the heart to interfere with it.&nbsp; Try to
picture it, silver-grey&mdash;I know how fond you are of
greys&mdash;a little white chiffon at neck and wrists, and the
prettiest pearl trimming.&nbsp; Then the hat <i>en suite</i>,
pale-grey lisse, white feather and brilliant buckle.&nbsp; All
these details are wasted upon you, sir, but you will like it when
you see it.&nbsp; It fulfils your ideal of tasteful simplicity,
which men always imagine to be an economical method of dressing,
until they have wives and milliners&rsquo; bills of their
own.</p>
<p>And now I have kept the biggest news to the last.&nbsp; Mother
has been to Madame, and she says that if she works all night, she
will have everything ready for the 30th.&nbsp; O Frank, does it
not seem incredible!&nbsp; Next Tuesday three weeks.&nbsp; And
the banns!&nbsp; Oh my goodness, I am frightened when I think
about it!&nbsp; Dear old boy, you won&rsquo;t tire of me, will
you?&nbsp; Whatever should I do if I thought you had tired of
me!&nbsp; And the worst of it is, that you don&rsquo;t know me a
bit.&nbsp; I have a hundred thousand faults, and you are blinded
by your love and cannot see them.&nbsp; But then some day the
scales will fall from your eyes, and you will perceive the whole
hundred thousand at once.&nbsp; Oh, what a reaction there will
be!&nbsp; You will see me as I am, frivolous, wilful, idle,
petulant, and altogether horrid.&nbsp; But I do love you, Frank,
with all my heart, and soul, and mind, and strength, and
you&rsquo;ll count that on the other side, won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp;
Now I am so glad I have said all this, because it is best that
you should know what you should expect.&nbsp; It will be nice for
you to look back and to say, &lsquo;She gave me fair warning, and
she is no worse than she said.&rsquo;&nbsp; O Frank, think of the
30th.</p>
<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I forgot to say that I had a grey silk cape,
lined with cream, to go with the dress.&nbsp; It is just
sweet!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>So that is how they arranged about the date.</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>THE
OVERTURE CONTINUED<br />
II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN A MINOR KEY</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Woking</i>, <i>June</i>
7<i>th</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My own dearest Maude</span>,&mdash;How I
wish you were here, for I have been down, down, down, in the
deepest state of despondency all day.&nbsp; I have longed to hear
the sound of your voice, or to feel the touch of your hand!&nbsp;
How can I be despondent, when in three weeks I shall be the
husband of the dearest girl in England?&nbsp; That is what I ask
myself, and then the answer comes that it is just exactly on that
account that my wretched conscience is gnawing at me.&nbsp; I
feel that I have not used you well; I owe you reparation, and I
don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>In your last dear letter you talk about being frivolous.&nbsp;
<i>You</i> have never been frivolous.&nbsp; But I have been
frivolous&mdash;for ever since I have learned to love you, I have
been so wrapped up in my love, with my happiness gilding
everything about me, that I have never really faced the prosaic
facts of life or discussed with you what our marriage will really
necessitate.&nbsp; And now, at this eleventh hour, I realise that
I have led you on in ignorance to an act which will perhaps take
a great deal of the sunshine out of your life.&nbsp; What have I
to offer you in exchange for the sacrifice which you will make
for me?&nbsp; Myself, my love, and all that I have&mdash;but how
little it all amounts to!&nbsp; You are a girl in a thousand, in
ten thousand&mdash;bright, beautiful, sweet, the dearest lady in
all the land.&nbsp; And I an average man&mdash;or perhaps hardly
that&mdash;with little to boast of in the past, and vague
ambitions for the future.&nbsp; It is a poor bargain for you, a
most miserable bargain.&nbsp; You have still time.&nbsp; Count
the cost, and if it be too great, then draw back even now without
fear of one word or inmost thought of reproach from me.&nbsp;
Your whole life is at stake.&nbsp; How can I hold you to a
decision which was taken before you realised what it meant?&nbsp;
Now I shall place the facts before you, and then, come what may,
my conscience will be at rest, and I shall be sure that you are
acting with your eyes open.</p>
<p>You have to compare your life as it is, and as it will
be.&nbsp; Your father is rich, or at least comfortably off, and
you have been accustomed all your life to have whatever you
desired.&nbsp; From what I know of your mother&rsquo;s kindness,
I should imagine that no wish of yours has ever remained
ungratified.&nbsp; You have lived well, dressed well, a sweet
home, a lovely garden, your collie, your canary, your maid.&nbsp;
Above all, you have never had anxiety, never had to worry about
the morrow.&nbsp; I can see all your past life so well.&nbsp; In
the mornings, your music, your singing, your gardening, your
reading.&nbsp; In the afternoons, your social duties, the visit
and the visitor.&nbsp; In the evening, tennis, a walk, music
again, your father&rsquo;s return from the City, the happy
family-circle, with occasionally the dinner, the dance, and the
theatre.&nbsp; And so smoothly on, month after month, and year
after year, your own sweet, kindly, joyous nature, and your
bright face, making every one round you happy, and so reacting
upon your own happiness.&nbsp; Why should you bother about
money?&nbsp; That was your father&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; Why
should you trouble about housekeeping?&nbsp; That was your
mother&rsquo;s duty.&nbsp; You lived like the birds and the
flowers, and had no need to take heed for the future.&nbsp;
Everything which life could offer was yours.</p>
<p>And now you must turn to what is in store for you, if you are
still content to face the future with me.&nbsp; Position I have
none to offer.&nbsp; What is the exact position of the wife of
the assistant-accountant of the Co-operative Insurance
Office?&nbsp; It is indefinable.&nbsp; What are my
prospects?&nbsp; I may become head-accountant.&nbsp; If Dinton
died&mdash;and I hope he won&rsquo;t, for he is an excellent
fellow&mdash;I should probably get his berth.&nbsp; Beyond that I
have no career.&nbsp; I have some aspirations after
literature&mdash;a few critical articles in the
monthlies&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t suppose they will ever lead to
anything of consequence.</p>
<p>And my income, &pound;400 a year with a commission on business
I introduce.&nbsp; But that amounts to hardly anything.&nbsp; You
have &pound;50.&nbsp; Our total, then, is certainly under
&pound;500.&nbsp; Have you considered what it will mean to leave
that charming house at St. Albans&mdash;the breakfast-room, the
billiard-room, the lawn&mdash;and to live in the little &pound;50
a year house at Woking, with its two sitting-rooms and pokey
garden?&nbsp; Have I a right to ask you to do such a thing?&nbsp;
And then the housekeeping, the planning, the arranging, the
curtailing, the keeping up appearances upon a limited
income.&nbsp; I have made myself miserable, because I feel that
you are marrying me without a suspicion of the long weary uphill
struggle which lies before you.&nbsp; O Maude, my darling Maude,
I feel that you sacrifice too much for me!&nbsp; If I were a man
I should say to you, &lsquo;Forget me&mdash;forget it all!&nbsp;
Let our relations be a closed chapter in your life.&nbsp; You can
do better.&nbsp; I and my cares come like a great cloud-bank to
keep the sunshine from your young life.&nbsp; You who are so
tender and dainty!&nbsp; How can I bear to see you exposed to the
drudgery and sordid everlasting cares of such a household!&nbsp;
I think of your graces, your pretty little ways, the elegancies
of your life, and how charmingly you carry them off.&nbsp; You
are born and bred for just such an atmosphere as the one which
you breathe.&nbsp; And I take advantage of my good-fortune in
winning your love to drag you down, to take the beauty and charm
from your life, to fill it with small and vulgar cares,
never-ending and soul-killing.&nbsp; Selfish beast that I am, why
should I allow you to come down into the stress and worry of
life, when I found you so high above it?&nbsp; And what can I
offer you in exchange?&rsquo;&nbsp; These are the thoughts which
come back and back all day, and leave me in the blackest fit of
despondency.&nbsp; I confessed to you that I had dark humours,
but never one so hopeless as this.&nbsp; I do not wish my worst
enemy to be as unhappy as I have been to-day.</p>
<p>Write to me, my own darling Maude, and tell me all you think,
your very inmost soul, in this matter.&nbsp; Am I right?&nbsp;
Have I asked too much of you?&nbsp; Does the change frighten
you?&nbsp; You will have this in the morning, and I should have
my answer by the evening post.&nbsp; I shall meet the
postman.&nbsp; How hard I shall try not to snatch the letter from
him, or to give myself away.&nbsp; Wilson has been in worrying me
with foolish talk, while my thoughts were all of our
affairs.&nbsp; He worked me up into a perfectly homicidal frame
of mind, but I hope that I kept on smiling and was not
discourteous to him.&nbsp; I wonder which is right, to be polite
but hypocritical, or to be inhospitable but honest.</p>
<p>Good-bye, my own dearest sweetheart&mdash;all the dearer when
I feel that I may lose you.&mdash;Ever your devoted</p>

<p>Frank, tell me for Heaven&rsquo;s sake what your letter
means!&nbsp; You use words of love, and yet you talk of
parting.&nbsp; You speak as if our love were a thing which we
might change or suppress.&nbsp; O Frank, you cannot take my love
away from me.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what you are to me, my
heart, my life, my all.&nbsp; I would give my life for you
willingly, gladly&mdash;every beat of my heart is for you.&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t know what you have become to me.&nbsp; My every
thought is yours, and has been ever since that night at the
Arlingtons&rsquo;.&nbsp; My love is so deep and strong, it rules
my whole life, my every action from morning to night.&nbsp; It is
the very breath and heart of my life&mdash;unchangeable.&nbsp; I
could not alter my love any more than I could stop my heart from
beating.&nbsp; How could you, could you suggest such a
thing!&nbsp; I know that you really love me just as much as I
love you, or I should not open my heart like this.&nbsp; I should
be too proud to give myself away.&nbsp; But I feel that pride is
out of place when any mistake or misunderstanding may mean
lifelong misery to both of us.&nbsp; I would only say good-bye if
I thought your love had changed or grown less.&nbsp; But I know
that it has not.&nbsp; O my darling, if you only knew what
terrible agony the very thought of parting is, you would never
have let such an idea even for an instant, on any pretext, enter
your mind.&nbsp; The very possibility is too awful to think
of.&nbsp; When I read your letter just now up in my room, I
nearly fainted.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t write.&nbsp; O Frank,
don&rsquo;t take my love away from me.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t bear
it.&nbsp; Oh no, it is my everything.&nbsp; If I could only see
you now, I know that you would kiss these heart-burning tears
away.&nbsp; I feel so lonely and tired.&nbsp; I cannot follow all
your letter.&nbsp; I only know that you talked of parting, and
that I am weary and miserable.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Coming up eight-fifteen, arrive

<p style="text-align: right"><i>June</i> 10<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>How good of you, dear old boy, to come racing across two
counties at a minute&rsquo;s notice, simply in order to console
me and clear away my misunderstandings.&nbsp; Of course it was
most ridiculous of me to take your letter so much to heart, but
when I read any suggestion about our parting, it upset me so
dreadfully, that I was really incapable of reasoning about
anything else.&nbsp; Just that one word PART seemed to be written
in letters of fire right across the page, to the exclusion of
everything else.&nbsp; So then I wrote an absurd letter to my
boy, and the dear came scampering right across the South of
England, and arrived at midnight in the most demoralised
state.&nbsp; It was just sweet of you to come, dear, and I shall
never forget it.</p>
<p>I am so sorry that I have been so foolish, but you must
confess, sir, that you have been just a little bit foolish
also.&nbsp; The idea of supposing that when I love a man my love
can be affected by the size of his house or the amount of his
income.&nbsp; It makes me smile to think of it.&nbsp; Do you
suppose a woman&rsquo;s happiness is affected by whether she has
a breakfast-room, or a billiard-board, or a collie dog, or any of
the other luxuries which you enumerated?&nbsp; But these things
are all the merest trimmings of life.&nbsp; They are not the
essentials.&nbsp; <i>You</i> and your love are the
essentials.&nbsp; Some one who will love me with all his
heart.&nbsp; Some one whom I can love with all my heart.&nbsp; Oh
the difference it makes in life!&nbsp; How it changes
everything!&nbsp; It glorifies and beautifies everything.&nbsp; I
always felt that I was capable of a great love&mdash;and now I
have it.</p>
<p>Fancy your imagining that you had come into my life in order
to darken it.&nbsp; Why, you <i>are</i> my life.&nbsp; If you
went out of it, what would be left?&nbsp; You talk about my
happiness before I met you&mdash;but oh, how empty it all
was!&nbsp; I read, and played, and sang as you say, but what a
void there was!&nbsp; I did it to please mother, but there really
seemed no very clear reason why I should continue to do it.&nbsp;
Then you came, and everything was changed.&nbsp; I read because
you are fond of reading and because I wanted to talk about books
with you.&nbsp; I played because you are fond of music.&nbsp; I
sang in the hope that it might please you.&nbsp; Whatever I did,
you were always in my mind.&nbsp; I tried and tried to become a
better and nobler woman, because I wanted to be worthy of the
love you bore me.&nbsp; I have changed, and developed, and
improved more in the last three months than in all my life
before.&nbsp; And then you come and tell me that you have
darkened my life.&nbsp; You know better now.&nbsp; My life has
become full and rich, for Love fills my life.&nbsp; It is the
keynote of my nature, the foundation, the motive power.&nbsp; It
inspires me to make the most of any gift or talent that I
have.&nbsp; How could I tell you all this if I did not know that
your own feeling was as deep.&nbsp; I could not have given the
one, great, and only love of my life in exchange for a
half-hearted affection from you.&nbsp; But you will never again
make the mistake of supposing that any material consideration can
affect our love.</p>
<p>And now we won&rsquo;t be serious any longer.&nbsp; Dear
mother was very much astounded by your tumultuous midnight
arrival, and equally precipitate departure next morning.&nbsp;
Dear old boy, it was so nice of you!&nbsp; But you won&rsquo;t
ever have horrid black humours and think miserable things any
more, will you?&nbsp; But if you must have dark days, now is your
time, for I can&rsquo;t possibly permit any after the
30th.&mdash;Ever your own</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My own dearest Girlie</span>,&mdash;How
perfectly sweet you are!&nbsp; I read and re-read your letter,
and I understand more and more how infinitely your nature is
above mine.&nbsp; And your conception of love&mdash;how lofty and
unselfish it is!&nbsp; How could I lower it by thinking that any
worldly thing could be weighed for an instant against it!&nbsp;
And yet it was just my jealous love for you, and my keenness that
you should never be the worse through me, which led me to write
in that way, so I will not blame myself too much.&nbsp; I am
really glad that the cloud came, for the sunshine is so much
brighter afterwards.&nbsp; And I seem to know you so much better,
and to see so much more deeply into your nature.&nbsp; I knew
that my own passion for you was the very essence of my
soul&mdash;oh, how hard it is to put the extreme of emotion into
the terms of human speech!&mdash;but I did not dare to hope that
your feelings were as deep.&nbsp; I hardly ventured to tell even
you how I really felt.&nbsp; Somehow, in these days of
lawn-tennis and afternoon tea, a strong strong passion, such a
passion as one reads of in books and poems, seems out of
place.&nbsp; I thought that it would surprise, even frighten you,
perhaps, if I were to tell you all that I felt.&nbsp; And now you
have written me two letters, which contain all that I should have
said if I had spoken from my heart.&nbsp; It is all my own inmost
thought, and there is not a feeling that I do not share.&nbsp; O
Maude, I may write lightly and speak lightly, perhaps, sometimes,
but there never was a woman, never, never in all the story of the
world, who was loved more passionately than you are loved by
me.&nbsp; Come what may, while the world lasts and the breath of
life is between my lips, you are the one woman to me.&nbsp; If we
are together, I care nothing for what the future may bring.&nbsp;
If we are not together, all the world cannot fill the void.</p>
<p>You say that I have given an impulse to your life: that you
read more, study more, take a keener interest in
everything.&nbsp; You could not possibly have said a thing which
could have given me more pleasure than that.&nbsp; It is
splendid!&nbsp; It justifies me in aspiring to you.&nbsp; It
satisfies my conscience over everything which I have done.&nbsp;
It must be right if that is the effect.&nbsp; I have felt so
happy and light-hearted ever since you said it.&nbsp; It is
rather absurd to think that <i>I</i> should improve you, but if
you in your sweet frankness say that it is so, why, I can only
marvel and rejoice.</p>
<p>But you must not study and work too hard.&nbsp; You say that
you do it to please me, but that would not please me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll tell you an anecdote as a dreadful example.&nbsp; I
had a friend who was a great lover of Eastern literature,
Sanskrit, and so on.&nbsp; He loved a lady.&nbsp; The lady to
please him worked hard at these subjects also.&nbsp; In a month
she had shattered her nervous system, and will perhaps never be
the same again.&nbsp; It was impossible.&nbsp; She was not meant
for it, and yet she made herself a martyr over it.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mean by this parable that it will be a strain upon
your intellect to keep up with mine.&nbsp; But I do mean that a
woman&rsquo;s mind is <i>different</i> from a man&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
A dainty rapier is a finer thing than a hatchet, but it is not
adapted for cutting down trees all the same.</p>
<p>Rupton Hale, the architect, one of the few friends I have down
here, has some most deplorable views about women.&nbsp; I played
a round of the Byfleet Golf Links with him upon Wednesday
afternoon, and we discussed the question of women&rsquo;s
intellects.&nbsp; He would have it that they have never a light
of their own, but are always the reflectors of some other light
which you cannot see.&nbsp; He would allow that they were
extraordinarily quick in assimilating another person&rsquo;s
views, but that was all.&nbsp; I quoted some very shrewd remarks
which a lady had made to me at dinner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Those are the
traces of the last man,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; According to his
preposterous theory, you could in conversation with a woman
reconstruct the last man who had made an impression to her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She will reflect you upon the next person she talks
to,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; It was ungallant, but it was
ingenious.</p>
<p>Dearest sweetheart, before I stop, let me tell you that if I
have brought any happiness into your life, you have brought far,
far more into mine.&nbsp; My soul seemed to come into full being
upon the day when I loved you.&nbsp; It was so small, and
cramped, and selfish, before&mdash;and life was so hard, and
stupid, and purposeless.&nbsp; To live, to sleep, to eat, for
some years, and then to die&mdash;it was so trivial and so
material.&nbsp; But now the narrow walls seem in an instant to
have fallen, and a boundless horizon stretches around me.&nbsp;
And everything appears beautiful.&nbsp; London Bridge, King
William Street, Abchurch Lane, the narrow stair, the office with
the almanacs and the shining desks, it has all become glorified,
tinged with a golden haze.&nbsp; I am stronger: I step out
briskly and breathe more deeply.&nbsp; And I am a better man
too.&nbsp; God knows there was room for it.&nbsp; But I do try to
make an ideal, and to live up to it.&nbsp; I feel such a fraud
when I think of being put upon a pedestal by you, when some
little hole where I am out of sight is my true place.&nbsp; I am
like the man in Browning who mourned over the spots upon his
&lsquo;speckled hide,&rsquo; but rejoiced in the swansdown of his
lady.&nbsp; And so, my own dear sweet little swansdown lady,
good-night to you, with my heart&rsquo;s love now and for ever
from your true lover,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span

<p>Saturday!&nbsp; Saturday!&nbsp; Saturday! oh, how I am longing
for Saturday, when I shall see you again!&nbsp; We will go on
Sunday and hear the banns together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Frank</span>,&mdash;What a
dreadful thing it is to have your name shouted out in
public!&nbsp; And what a voice the man had!&nbsp; He simply
bellowed &lsquo;Maude Selby of this parish&rsquo; as if he meant
all this parish to know about it.&nbsp; And then he let you off
so easily.&nbsp; I suppose he thought that there was no local
interest in Frank Crosse of Woking.&nbsp; But when he looked
round expectantly, after asking whether there was any known cause
or just impediment why we should not be joined together, it gave
me quite a thrill.&nbsp; I felt as if some one would jump up like
a Jack-in-the-box and make a scene in the church.&nbsp; How
relieved I was when he changed the subject!&nbsp; I sank my face
in my hands, but I know that I was blushing all down my
neck.&nbsp; Then I looked at you between my fingers, and there
you were sitting quite cool and cheerful, as if you rather liked
it.&nbsp; I think that we shall go to evening-service next
week.&nbsp; Papa has given up going altogether since the new
organist came.&nbsp; He says he cannot face the music.</p>
<p>What a sweet time we had together.&nbsp; I shall never, never
forget it!&nbsp; O Frank, how good you are to me!&nbsp; And how I
hope you won&rsquo;t regret what you are doing.&nbsp; It is all
very well just now, when I am young and you think that I am
pretty.&nbsp; I love that you should think so, but I am compelled
to tell you that it is not really so.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t imagine
how you came to think it!&nbsp; I suppose it was from seeing me
so often beside papa.&nbsp; If you saw me near Nelly Sheridan, or
any other <i>really</i> pretty girl, you would at once see the
difference.&nbsp; It just happens that you like grey eyes and
brown hair, and the other things, but that does not mean that I
am really pretty.&nbsp; I should be so sorry if there were any
misunderstanding about this, and you only found out when too
late.&nbsp; You ought to keep this letter for reference, as papa
always says, and then it will be interesting to you
afterwards.</p>
<p>I should like you to see me now&mdash;or rather I
wouldn&rsquo;t have you see me for the world.&nbsp; I am so
flushed and untidy, for I have been cooking.&nbsp; Is it not
absurd, if you come to think of it, that we girls should be
taught the irregular French verbs, and the geography of China,
and never to cook the simplest thing?&nbsp; It really does seem
ridiculous.</p>
<p>But it is never too late to mend, so I went into the kitchen
this morning and made a tart.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t imagine what
a lot of things one needs even for such a simple thing as
that.&nbsp; I thought cook was joking when she put them all down
in front of me.&nbsp; It was like a conjurer giving his
performance.&nbsp; There was an empty bowl, and a bowl full of
sliced apples, and a big board, and a rolling-pin, and eggs, and
butter, and sugar, and cloves, and of course flour.&nbsp; We
broke eggs and put them into a bowl&mdash;you can&rsquo;t think
what a mess an egg makes when it misses the bowl.&nbsp; Then we
stirred them up with flour and butter and things.&nbsp; I stirred
until I was perfectly exhausted.&nbsp; No wonder a cook has
usually a great thick arm.&nbsp; Then when it had formed a paste,
we rolled it out, and put the apples in the dish, and roofed it
in, and trimmed the edges, and stuck flat leaves made of paste
all over it, and the dearest little crown in the middle.&nbsp;
Then we put it into the oven until it was brown.&nbsp; It looked
a very nice tart, and mamma said that I had made it very
solidly.&nbsp; It certainly did feel very heavy for its
size.&nbsp; Mamma would not taste it, because she said that she
thought Dr. Tristram would not approve of her doing so, but I had
a piece, and really it was not so bad.&nbsp; Mamma said the
servants might have it at dinner, but the servants said that the
poor window-cleaner had a large family, and so we gave it to
him.&nbsp; It is so sweet to feel that one is of any use to any
one.</p>
<p>What do you think happened this morning?&nbsp; Two
wedding-presents arrived.&nbsp; The first was a very nice fish
slice and fork in a case.&nbsp; It was from dear old Mrs. Jones
Beyrick, on whom we really had no claim whatever.&nbsp; We all
think it so kind of her, and such a nice fish-slice.&nbsp; The
other was a beautiful travelling-bag from Uncle Arthur.&nbsp;
Stamped in gold upon it were the letters M.C., I said, &lsquo;Oh,
what a pity!&nbsp; They have put the wrong initials.&rsquo;&nbsp;
That made mamma laugh.&nbsp; I suppose one soon gets used to
it.&nbsp; Fancy how you would feel if it were the other way
about, and you changed your name to mine.&nbsp; They might call
you Selby, but you would continue to feel Crosse.&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t mean that for a joke, but women make jokes without
intending it.&nbsp; The other day the curate drove up in his
donkey-cart, and mother said, &lsquo;Oh, what a nice
tandem!&rsquo;&nbsp; I think that she meant to say
&lsquo;turn-out&rsquo;; but papa said it was the neatest thing he
had heard for a long time, so mamma is very pleased, but I am
sure that she does not know even now why it should be so
funny.</p>
<p>What stupid letters I write!&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t it frighten
you when you read them and think that is the person with whom I
have to spend my life.&nbsp; Yet you never seem alarmed about
it.&nbsp; I think it is so <i>brave</i> of you.&nbsp; That
reminds me that I never finished what I wanted to say at the
beginning of this letter.&nbsp; Even supposing that I am pretty
(and my complexion sometimes is simply awful), you must bear in
mind how quickly the years slip by, and how soon a woman
alters.&nbsp; Why, we shall hardly be married before you will
find me full of wrinkles, and without a tooth in my head.&nbsp;
Poor boy, how dreadful for you!&nbsp; Men seem to change so
little and so slowly.&nbsp; Besides, it does not matter for them,
for nobody marries a man because he is pretty.&nbsp; But you must
marry me, Frank, not for what I look but for what I am&mdash;for
my inmost, inmost self, so that if I had no body at all, you
would love me just the same.&nbsp; That is how I love you, but I
do prefer you with your body on all the same.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know how I love you, dear.&nbsp; I only know that I am in a dream
when you are near me&mdash;just a beautiful dream.&nbsp; I live
for those moments.&mdash;Ever your own little</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Maude</span>.</p>
<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Papa gave us such a fright, for he came in
just now and said that the window-cleaner and all his family were
very ill.&nbsp; This was a joke, because the coachman had told
him about my tart.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it horrid of him?</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Woking</i>, <i>June</i>
17<i>th</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My own sweetest Maude</span>,&mdash;I do
want you to come up to town on Saturday morning.&nbsp; Then I
will see you home to St. Albans in the evening, and we shall have
another dear delightful week end.&nbsp; I think of nothing else,
and I count the hours.&nbsp; Now please to manage it, and
don&rsquo;t let anything stop you.&nbsp; You know that you can
always get your way.&nbsp; Oh yes, you can, miss!&nbsp; <i>I</i>
know.</p>
<p>We shall meet at the bookstall at Charing Cross railway
station at one o&rsquo;clock, but if anything should go wrong,
send me a wire to the Club.&nbsp; Then we can do some shopping
together, and have some fun also.&nbsp; Tell your mother that we
shall be back in plenty of time for dinner.&nbsp; Make another
tart, and I shall eat it.&nbsp; Things are slack at the office
just now, and I could be spared for a few days.</p>
<p>So you have had a fish-slice.&nbsp; It is so strange, because
on that very day I had my first present, and it was a fish-slice
also.&nbsp; We shall have fish at each end when we give a
dinner.&nbsp; If we get another fish-slice, then we shall give a
fish-dinner&mdash;or keep one of the slices to give to your
friend Nelly Sheridan when <i>she</i> gets married.&nbsp; They
will always come in useful.&nbsp; And I have had two more
presents.&nbsp; One is a Tantalus spirit-stand from my friends in
the office.&nbsp; The other is a pair of bronzes from the cricket
club.&nbsp; They got it up without my knowing anything about it,
and I was amazed when a deputation came up to my rooms with them
last night.&nbsp; &lsquo;May your innings be long and your
partnership unbroken until you each make a hundred not
out.&rsquo;&nbsp; That was the inscription upon a card.</p>
<p>I have something very grave to tell you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
going over my bills and things, and I owe ever so much more than
I thought.&nbsp; I have always been so careless, and never known
exactly how I stood.&nbsp; It did not matter when one was a
bachelor, for one always felt that one could live quite simply
for a few months, and so set matters straight.&nbsp; But now it
is more serious.&nbsp; The bills come to more than a hundred
pounds; the biggest one is forty-two pounds to Snell and Walker,
the Conduit Street tailors.&nbsp; However, I am ordering my
marriage-suit from them, and that will keep them quiet.&nbsp; I
have enough on hand to pay most of the others.&nbsp; But we must
not run short upon our honeymoon&mdash;what an awful idea!&nbsp;
Perhaps there may be some cheques among our presents.&nbsp; We
will hope for the best.</p>
<p>But there is a more serious thing upon which I want to consult
you.&nbsp; You asked me never to have any secrets from you, or
else I should not bother you about such things.&nbsp; I should
have kept it for Saturday when we meet, but I want you to have
time to think about it, so that we may come to some decision
then.</p>
<p>I am surety to a man for an indefinite sum of money.&nbsp; It
sounds rather dreadful, does it not?&nbsp; But it is not so bad
as it sounds, for there is no harm done yet.&nbsp; But the
question is what we should do in the future about it, and the
answer is not a very easy one.&nbsp; He is a very pleasant
fellow, an insurance agent, and he got into some trouble about
his accounts last year.&nbsp; The office would have dismissed
him, but as I knew his wife and his family, I became surety that
he should not go wrong again, and so I saved him from losing his
situation.&nbsp; His name is Farintosh.&nbsp; He is one of those
amiable, weak, good fellows whom you cannot help loving, although
you never can trust them.&nbsp; Of course we could give notice
that we should not be responsible any longer, but it would be a
thunderbolt to this poor family, and the man would certainly be
ruined.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want to begin our own happiness by
making any one else unhappy, do we?&nbsp; But we shall talk it
over, and I shall do what you advise.&nbsp; You understand that
we are only liable in case he defaults, and surely it is very
unlikely that he will do so after the lesson that he has already
had.</p>
<p>I think the house will do splendidly.&nbsp; The Lindens is the
name, and it is on the Maybury Road, not more than a quarter of a
mile from the station.&nbsp; If your mother and you could come
down on Tuesday or Wednesday, I should get a half-day off, and
you would be able to inspect it.&nbsp; Such a nice little lawn in
front, and garden behind.&nbsp; A conservatory, if you please,
dining-room and drawing-room.&nbsp; You can never assemble more
than four or five guests.&nbsp; On your at-home days, we shall
put up little placards as they do outside the theatres,
&lsquo;Drawing-room full,&rsquo; &lsquo;Dining-room full,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Room in the Conservatory.&rsquo;&nbsp; There are two good
bedrooms, one large maid&rsquo;s room, and a lumber-room.&nbsp;
One cook and one housemaid could run it beautifully.&nbsp; Rent
&pound;50 on a three years&rsquo; lease&mdash;with taxes, about

Hale says that we must be careful not to brush against the walls,

<p>What a dull, stupid letter!&nbsp; I do hope that I shall be in
good form on Saturday.&nbsp; I am a man of moods&mdash;worse
luck! and they come quite regardless of how I wish to be, or even
of how I have cause to be.&nbsp; I do hope that I shall make your
day bright for you&mdash;the last day that we shall have together
before <i>the</i> day.&nbsp; There have been times when I have
been such bad company to you, just when I wished to be at my
best.&nbsp; But you are always so sweet and patient and
soothing.&nbsp; Until Saturday, then, my own darling.&mdash;Ever
your lover,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span

<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I open this to tell you that such a gorgeous
fish-knife, with our monograms upon it, has just arrived from
Mrs. Preston, my father&rsquo;s old friend.&nbsp; I went to the
Goldsmith&rsquo;s Company in Regent Street yesterday afternoon,
and I bought&mdash;what do you think?&nbsp; It looks so beautiful
upon its snow-white cotton wadding.&nbsp; I like them very broad
and rather flat.&nbsp; I do hope you will think it all
right.&nbsp; It fills me with the strangest feelings when I look
at it.&nbsp; Come what may, foul weather or fair, sorrow or joy,
that little strip of gold will still be with us&mdash;we shall
see it until we can see no more.</p>
<p><i>P.P.S.</i>&mdash;Saturday!&nbsp; Saturday!!&nbsp;
Saturday!!!</p>
<h2><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>THE
TWO SOLOS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> tryst was at the Charing
Cross bookstall at one o&rsquo;clock, and so Mr. Frank Crosse was
there at quarter-past twelve, striding impatiently up and down,
and stopping dead whenever a woman emerged from the entrance,
like a pointer dog before a partridge.&nbsp; Before he came he
had been haunted by the idea that possibly Maude might have an
impulse to come early&mdash;and what if she were to arrive and
not find him there!&nbsp; Every second of her company was so dear
to him, that when driving to meet her he had sometimes changed
from one cab to another upon the way, because the second seemed
to have the faster horse.&nbsp; But now that he was on the ground
he realised that she was very exact to her word, and that she
would neither be early nor late.&nbsp; And yet, in the illogical
fashion of a lover, he soon forgot that it was he who was too
soon, and he chafed and chafed as the minutes passed, until at
about quarter to one he was striding gloomily about with
despondent features and melancholy forebodings, imagining a
thousand miserable reasons for her inexplicable delay.&nbsp; A
good many people stared at him as they passed, and we may do so
among the number.</p>
<p>In person Frank Crosse was neither tall nor short, five feet
eight and a half to be exact, with the well-knit frame and
springy step of a young man who had been an athlete from his
boyhood.&nbsp; He was slim, but wiry, and carried his head with a
half-defiant backward slant which told of pluck and breed.&nbsp;
His face was tanned brown, in spite of his City hours, but his
hair and slight moustache were flaxen, and his eyes, which were
his best features, were of a delicate blue, and could vary in
expression from something very tender to something particularly
hard.&nbsp; He was an orphan, and had inherited nothing from his
parents save a dash of the artist from his mother.&nbsp; It was
not enough to help him to earn a living, but it transformed
itself into a keen appreciation and some ambitions in literature,
and it gave a light and shade to his character which made him
rather complex, and therefore interesting.&nbsp; His best friends
could not deny the shade, and yet it was but the shadow thrown by
the light.&nbsp; Strength, virility, emotional force, power of
deep feeling&mdash;these are traits which have to be paid
for.&nbsp; There was sometimes just a touch of the savage, or at
least there were indications of the possibility of a touch of the
savage, in Frank Crosse.&nbsp; His intense love of the open air
and of physical exercise was a sign of it.&nbsp; He left upon
women the impression, not altogether unwelcome, that there were
unexplored recesses of his nature to which the most intimate of
them had never penetrated.&nbsp; In those dark corners of the
spirit either a saint or a sinner might be lurking, and there was
a pleasurable excitement in peering into them, and wondering
which it was.&nbsp; No woman ever found him dull.&nbsp; Perhaps
it would have been better for him if they had, for his impulsive
nature had never been long content with a chilly
friendship.&nbsp; He was, as we may see, a man with a past, but
it <i>was</i> a past, now that Maude Selby had come like an angel
of light across the shadowed path of his life.&nbsp; In age he
was nearly twenty-seven.</p>
<p>There are one or two things which might be said for him which
he would not have said for himself.&nbsp; He was an only child
and an orphan, but he had adopted his grandparents, who had been
left penniless through his father&rsquo;s death, and through all
his struggles he had managed to keep them happy and comfortable
in a little cottage in Worcestershire.&nbsp; Nor did he ever tell
them that he had a struggle&mdash;fearing lest it should make
their position painful; and so when their quarterly cheque
arrived, they took it as a kindly but not remarkable act of duty
upon the part of their wealthy grandson in the City, with no
suspicion as to the difference which their allowance was making
to him.&nbsp; Nor did he himself look upon his action as a
virtuous one, but simply as a thing which must obviously be
done.&nbsp; In the meantime, he had stuck closely to his work,
had won rapid promotion in the Insurance Office in which he had
started as junior clerk, had gained the goodwill of his superiors
through his frank, unaffected ways, and had been asked to play
for the second Surrey eleven at cricket.&nbsp; So without going
the length of saying that he was worthy of Maude Selby, one might
perhaps claim&mdash;if it could be done without endangering that
natural modesty which was one of his charms&mdash;that he was as
worthy as any other young man who was available.</p>
<p>That unfortunate artistic soul of his, which had been in the
tropics of expectation, and was now in the arctic of reaction,
had just finally settled down to black despair, with a grim
recognition of the fact that Maude had certainly and absolutely
given him up, when one boomed from the station clock, and on the
very stroke she hurried on to the platform.&nbsp; How could he
have strained his eyes after other women, as if a second glance
were ever needed when it was really she!&nbsp; The perfectly
graceful figure, the trimness and neatness of it, the beautiful
womanly poise of the head, the quick elastic step, he could have
sworn to her among ten thousand.&nbsp; His heart gave a bound at
the sight of her, but he had the English aversion to giving
himself away, and so he walked quickly forward to meet her with
an impassive face, but with a look in his eyes which was all that
she wanted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stood for a few moments looking at her in silence.&nbsp;
She had on the dress which he loved so much, a silver-grey merino
skirt and jacket, with a blouse of white pongee silk showing in
front.&nbsp; Some lighter coloured trimming fringed the
cloth.&nbsp; She wore a grey toque, with a dash of white at the
side, and a white veil which softened without concealing the dark
brown curls and fresh girlish face beneath it.&nbsp; Her gloves
were of grey su&egrave;de, and the two little pointed tan shoes
peeping from the edge of her skirt were the only touches of a
darker tint in her attire.&nbsp; Crosse had the hereditary
artist&rsquo;s eye, and he could only stand and stare and enjoy
it.&nbsp; He was filled with admiration, with reverence, and with
wonder that this perfect thing should really proclaim itself to
be all his own.&nbsp; Whatever had he done, or could he do, to
deserve it?</p>
<p>She looked up at him in a roguish sidelong way, with the
bright mischievous smile which was one of her charms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, do you approve?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove, it is splendid&mdash;beautiful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So glad!&nbsp; I hoped you would, since you are so fond
of greys.&nbsp; Besides, it is cooler in this weather.&nbsp; I
hope you have not been waiting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, that&rsquo;s all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You looked so solemn when first I saw you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then you just jumped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I like our feelings to be our
very very own, and never to show them to any one else at
all.&nbsp; I dare say it is absurd, but that is my
instinct.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, dear, it wasn&rsquo;t such a big jump as
all that.&nbsp; Where are we going?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come here, Maude, into the waiting-room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She followed him into the gloomy, smoky, dingy room.&nbsp;
Bare yellow benches framed an empty square of brown
linoleum.&nbsp; A labouring man with his wife and a child sat
waiting with the stolid patience of the poor in one corner.&nbsp;
They were starting on some Saturday afternoon excursion, and had
mistimed their train.&nbsp; Maude Selby and Frank Crosse took the
other corner.&nbsp; He drew a jeweller&rsquo;s box from his
pocket and removed the lid.&nbsp; Something sparkled among the
wadding.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank!&nbsp; Is that really it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you like it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a broad one it is!&nbsp; Mother&rsquo;s is quite
thin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They wear thin in time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is beautiful.&nbsp; Shall I try it on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There is some superstition about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But suppose it won&rsquo;t fit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is quite safe.&nbsp; I measured it with your
sapphire ring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t half scolded you enough about that
sapphire ring.&nbsp; How could you go and give twenty-two guineas
for a ring?&mdash;oh yes, sir, that was the price, for I saw a
duplicate yesterday in the Goldsmith&rsquo;s Company.&nbsp; You
dear extravagant old boy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had saved the money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But not for that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For nothing half or quarter as important.&nbsp; But I
had the other to the same size, so it is sure to fit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude had pushed up her veil, and sat with the little golden
circlet in her hand, looking down at it, while the dim watery
London sunlight poured through the window, and tagged all her
wandering curls with a coppery gleam.&nbsp; It was a face
beautiful in itself, but more beautiful for its
expression&mdash;sensitive, refined, womanly, full of innocent
archness and girlish mischief, but with a depth of expression in
the eyes, and a tender delicacy about the mouth, which spoke of a
great spirit with all its capacities for suffering and devotion
within.&nbsp; The gross admirer of merely physical charms might
have passed her over unnoticed.&nbsp; So might the man who is
attracted only by outward and obvious signs of character.&nbsp;
But to the man who could see, to the man whose own soul had
enough of spirituality to respond to hers, and whose eye could
appreciate the subtlety of a beauty which is of the mind as well
as of the body, there was not in all wide London upon that
midsummer day a sweeter girl than Maude Selby, as she sat in her
grey merino dress with the London sun tagging her brown curls
with that coppery glimmer.</p>
<p>She handed back the ring, and a graver expression passed over
her mobile face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel as you said in your letter, Frank.&nbsp; There
<i>is</i> something tragic in it.&nbsp; It will be with me for
ever.&nbsp; All the future will arrange itself round that little
ring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you afraid of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Afraid!&rsquo; her grey glove rested for an instant
upon the back of his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>
be afraid of anything if you were with me.&nbsp; It is really
extraordinary, for by nature I am so easily frightened.&nbsp; But
if I were with you in a railway accident or anywhere, it would be
just the same.&nbsp; You see I become for the time part of you,
as it were, and you are brave enough for two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t profess to be so brave as all
that,&rsquo; said Frank.&nbsp; &lsquo;I expect I have as many
nerves as my neighbours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude&rsquo;s grey toque nodded up and down.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
know all about that,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have such a false idea of me.&nbsp; It makes me
happy at the time and miserable afterwards, for I feel such a
rank impostor.&nbsp; You imagine me to be a hero, and a genius,
and all sorts of things, while I <i>know</i> that I am about as
ordinary a young fellow as walks the streets of London, and no
more worthy of you than&mdash;well, than any one else
is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laughed with shining eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like to hear you talk like that,&rsquo; said
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;That is just what is so beautiful about
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is hopeless to prove that you are not a hero when your
disclaimers are themselves taken as a proof of heroism.&nbsp;
Frank shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only hope you&rsquo;ll find me out gradually and not
suddenly,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, Maude, we have all
day and all London before us.&nbsp; What shall we do?&nbsp; I
want you to choose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am quite happy whatever we do.&nbsp; I am content to
sit here with you until evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her idea of a happy holiday set them both laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come along,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;we shall discuss it
as we go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The workman&rsquo;s family was still waiting, and Maude handed
the child a shilling as she went out.&nbsp; She was so happy
herself that she wanted every one else to be happy also.&nbsp;
The people turned to look at her as she passed.&nbsp; With the
slight flush upon her cheeks and the light in her eyes, she
seemed the personification of youth, and life, and love.&nbsp;
One tall old gentleman started as he looked, and watched her with
a rapt face until she disappeared.&nbsp; Some cheek had flushed
and some eye had brightened at his words once, and sweet old days
had for an instant lived again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we have a cab?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, we must learn to be economical.&nbsp; Let us
walk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t be economical
to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There now!&nbsp; See what a bad influence I have upon
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most demoralising!&nbsp; But we have not settled yet
where we are to go to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What <i>does</i> it matter, if we are
together?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a good match at the Oval, the Australians
against Surrey.&nbsp; Would you care to see that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear, if you would.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there are matin&eacute;es at all the
theatres.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would rather be in the open air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All I want is that you should enjoy
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never fear.&nbsp; I shall do that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, first of all I vote that we go and have
some lunch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They started across the station yard, and passed the beautiful
old stone cross.&nbsp; Among the hansoms and the four-wheelers,
the hurrying travellers, and the lounging cabmen, there rose that
lovely reconstruction of medi&aelig;valism, the pious memorial of
a great Plantagenet king to his beloved wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Six hundred years ago,&rsquo; said Frank, as they
paused and looked up, &lsquo;that old stone cross was completed,
with heralds and armoured knights around it to honour her whose
memory was honoured by the king.&nbsp; Now the corduroyed porters
stand where the knights stood, and the engines whistle where the
heralds trumpeted, but the old cross is the same as ever in the
same old place.&nbsp; It is a little thing of that sort which
makes one realise the unbroken history of our country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude insisted upon hearing about Queen Eleanor, and Frank
imparted the little that he knew as they walked out into the
crowded Strand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was Edward the First&rsquo;s wife, and a splendid
woman.&nbsp; It was she, you remember, who sucked the wound when
he was stabbed with a poisoned dagger.&nbsp; She died somewhere
in the north, and he had the body carried south to bury it in
Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; Wherever it rested for a night he built
a cross, and so you have a line of crosses all down England to
show where that sad journey was broken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They had turned down Whitehall, and passed the big cuirassiers
upon their black chargers at the gate of the Horse Guards.&nbsp;
Frank pointed to one of the windows of the old
banqueting-hall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve seen a memorial of a queen of
England,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;That window is the memorial
of a king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why so, Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe that it was through that window that Charles
the First passed out to the scaffold when his head was cut
off.&nbsp; It was the first time that the people had ever shown
that they claimed authority over their king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo; said Maude.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was so
handsome, and such a good husband and father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the good kings who may be the dangerous
ones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If a king thinks only of pleasure, then he does not
interfere with matters of state.&nbsp; But if he is
conscientious, he tries to do what he imagines to be his duty,
and so he causes trouble.&nbsp; Look at Charles, for
example.&nbsp; He was a very good man, and yet he caused a civil
war.&nbsp; George the Third was a most exemplary character, but
his stupidity lost us America, and nearly lost us Ireland.&nbsp;
They were each succeeded by thoroughly bad men, who did far less
harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the end of Whitehall, and the splendid
panorama of Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament lay
before them.&nbsp; The most stately of ancient English buildings
was contrasted with the most beautiful of modern ones.&nbsp; How
anything so graceful came to be built by this tasteless and
utilitarian nation must remain a marvel to the traveller.&nbsp;
The sun was shining upon the gold-work of the roof, and the grand
towers sprang up amid the light London haze, like some gorgeous
palace in a dream.&nbsp; It was a fit centre for the rule to
whose mild sway one-fifth of the human race acquiesces&mdash;a
rule upheld by so small a force that only the consent of the
governed can sustain it.</p>
<p>Frank and Maude stood together looking up at it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How beautiful it is!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
the gilding lights up the whole building!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how absurd it is not to employ it more in our
gloomy London architecture!&rsquo; said Frank.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Imagine how grand a gilded dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s would
look, hanging like a rising sun over the City.&nbsp; But here is
our restaurant, Maude, and Big Ben says that it is a quarter to
two.</p>
<h2><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>IN
BRITAIN&rsquo;S VALHALLA</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had discussed the rooms in
their new house, and the bridesmaids&rsquo; dresses, and
Maude&rsquo;s cooking, and marriage-presents, and the merits of
Brighton, and the nature of love, and volleying at tennis (Maude
was the lady-champion of a tennis club), and season tickets, and
the destiny of the universe&mdash;to say nothing of a small
bottle of Perrier Jouet.&nbsp; It was reprehensibly extravagant,
but this would be their last unmarried excursion, and so they
drank to the dear days of the past, and the dearer ones of the
future.&nbsp; Good comrades as well as lovers, they talked
freely, and with pleasure.&nbsp; Frank never made the common
mistake of talking down, and Maude justified his confidence by
eagerly keeping up.&nbsp; To both of them silence was preferable
to conventional small talk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll just get down there after lunch,&rsquo;
said Frank, as he paid his bill.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have not seen
the Australians, have you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear, I saw them at Clifton four years
ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But this is a new lot.&nbsp; There are nine of the
present team who have never played in England before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are very good, are they not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good indeed.&nbsp; And the dry summer has helped
them.&nbsp; It is the sticky English wickets which put them
off.&nbsp; The wickets are very fast over there.&nbsp; Giffen is
their best all-round man, but Darling and Iredale and young Hill
are good enough for anything.&nbsp; Well, then&mdash;O Lord, what
a pity!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had turned towards the window as he rose, and saw one of
those little surprises by which Nature relieves the monotony of
life in these islands.&nbsp; The sun had gone, a ragged
slate-coloured cloud was drifting up from over the river, and the
rain was falling with a soft persistency which is more fatal than
the most boisterous shower.&nbsp; There would be no more cricket
that day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two coffees and two benedictines,&rsquo; cried Frank,
and they relapsed into their chairs.&nbsp; But a half-hour passed
and the grey cloud was thicker and the rain more heavy.&nbsp; The
cheerless leaden river flowed slowly under drifting skies.&nbsp;
Beyond an expanse of shining pavement the great black Abbey
towered amidst the storm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you ever done the Abbey, Maude?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Frank; I should love to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have only been once&mdash;more shame to me to say
so!&nbsp; Is it not a sin that we young Englishmen should be
familiar with every music-hall in London and should know so
little of this which is the centre of the British race, the most
august and tremendous monument that ever a nation owned.&nbsp;
Six hundred years ago the English looked upon it as their holiest
and most national shrine, and since then our kings and our
warriors and our thinkers and our poets have all been laid there,
until there is such an accumulation that the huge Abbey has
hardly space for another monument.&nbsp; Let us spend an hour
inside it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They made for Solomon&rsquo;s porch, since it was the nearest
and they had but the one umbrella.&nbsp; Under its shelter they
brushed themselves dry before they entered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom does the Abbey belong to, Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To you and me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now you are joking!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; It belongs in the long-run to the
British taxpayer.&nbsp; You have heard the story of the Scotch
visitor who came on board one of our battleships and asked to see
the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who shall I say?&rdquo; said the
sentry.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the proprietors,&rdquo; said the
Scotchman.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s <i>our</i> position towards the
Abbey.&nbsp; Let us inspect our property.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were smiling as they entered, but the smile faded from
their lips as the door closed behind them.&nbsp; In this holy of
holies, this inner sanctuary of the race, there was a sense of
serene and dignified solemnity which would have imposed itself
upon the most thoughtless.&nbsp; Frank and Maude stood in mute
reverence.&nbsp; The high arches shot up in long rows upon either
side of them, straight and slim as beautiful trees, until they
curved off far up near the clerestory and joined their sister
curves to form the lightest, most delicate tracery of
stone.&nbsp; In front of them a great rose-window of stained
glass, splendid with rich purples and crimsons, shone through a
subdued and reverent gloom.&nbsp; Here and there in the aisles a
few spectators moved among the shadows, but all round along the
walls two and three deep were ranged the illustrious dead, the
perishable body within, the lasting marble without, and the more
lasting name beneath.&nbsp; It was very silent in the home of the
great dead&mdash;only a distant footfall or a subdued murmur here
and there.&nbsp; Maude knelt down and sank her face in her
hands.&nbsp; Frank prayed also with that prayer which is a
feeling rather than an utterance.</p>
<p>Then they began to move round the short transept in which they
found themselves&mdash;a part of the Abbey reserved for the great
statesmen.&nbsp; Frank tried to quote the passage in which
Macaulay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle
of the neighbouring parliament-hall, and coming hither for peace
and rest.&nbsp; Here were the men who had been strong enough to
grasp the helm, and who, sometimes wisely, sometimes foolishly,
but always honestly, had tried to keep the old ship before the
wind.&nbsp; Canning and Peel were there, with Pitt, Fox, Grattan
and Beaconsfield.&nbsp; Governments and oppositions moulder
behind the walls.&nbsp; Beaconsfield alone among all the statues
showed the hard-lined face of the self-made man.&nbsp; These
others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realise how strong
they were, but they sprang from those ruling castes to whom
strength came by easy inheritance.&nbsp; Frank told Maude the
little which he knew of each of them&mdash;of Grattan, the
noblest Irishman of them all, of Castlereagh, whose coffin was
pursued to the gates of the Abbey by a raging mob who wished to
tear out his corpse, of Fox the libertine philosopher, of
Palmerston the gallant sportsman, who rode long after he could
walk.&nbsp; They marvelled together at the realism of the
sculptor who had pitted Admiral Warren with the smallpox, and at
the absurdity of that other one who had clad Robert Peel in a
Roman toga.</p>
<p>Then turning to the right at the end of the Statesmen&rsquo;s
Transept, they wandered aimlessly down the huge nave.&nbsp; It
was overwhelming, the grandeur of the roof above and of the
contents below.&nbsp; Any one of hundreds of these tombs was
worth a devout pilgrimage, but how could one raise his soul to
the appreciation of them all.&nbsp; Here was Darwin who
revolutionised zoology, and here was Isaac Newton who gave a new
direction to astronomy.&nbsp; Here were old Ben Jonson, and
Stephenson the father of railways, and Livingstone of Africa, and
Wordsworth, and Kingsley, and Arnold.&nbsp; Here were the
soldiers of the mutiny&mdash;Clyde and Outram and
Lawrence,&mdash;and painters, and authors, and surgeons, and all
the good sons who in their several degrees had done loyal service
to the old mother.&nbsp; And when their service was done the old
mother had stretched out that long arm of hers and had brought
them home, and always for every good son brought home she had
sent another forth, and her loins were ever fruitful, and her
children loving and true.&nbsp; Go into the Abbey and think, and
as the nation&rsquo;s past is borne in upon you, you will have no
fear for its future.</p>
<p>Frank was delighted with some of the monuments and horrified
by others, and he communicated both his joy and his anger to
Maude.&nbsp; They noticed together how the moderns and the
Elizabethans had much in common in their types of face, their way
of wearing the hair, and their taste in monuments, while between
them lie the intolerable affectations&mdash;which culminated
towards the end of last century.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It all rings false&mdash;statue, inscription,
everything,&rsquo; said Frank.&nbsp; &lsquo;These insufferable
allegorical groups sprawling round a dead hero are of the same
class as the pompous and turgid prose of Doctor Johnson.&nbsp;
The greatest effects are the simplest effects, and so it always
was and so it always will be.&nbsp; But that little bit of Latin
is effective, I confess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a very much defaced inscription underneath a battered
Elizabethan effigy, whose feet had been knocked off, and whose
features were blurred into nothing.&nbsp; Two words of the
inscription had caught Frank&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Moestissima uxor</i>!&nbsp; It was his &ldquo;most
sad wife&rdquo; who erected it!&nbsp; Look at it now!&nbsp; The
poor battered monument of a woman&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; Now, Maude,
come with me, and we shall visit the famous Poets&rsquo;
Corner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What an assembly it would be if at some supreme day each man
might stand forth from the portals of his tomb.&nbsp; Tennyson,
the last and almost the greatest of that illustrious line, lay
under the white slab upon the floor.&nbsp; Maude and Frank stood
reverently beside it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Sunset and evening Star<br />
And one clear call for me.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frank quoted.&nbsp; &lsquo;What lines for a very old man to
write!&nbsp; I should put him second only to Shakespeare had I
the marshalling of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have read so little,&rsquo; said Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will read it all together after next week.&nbsp; But
it makes your reading so much more real and intimate when you
have stood at the grave of the man who wrote.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
Chaucer, the big tomb there.&nbsp; He is the father of British
poetry.&nbsp; Here is Browning beside Tennyson&mdash;united in
life and in death.&nbsp; He was the more profound thinker, but
music and form are essential also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a splendid face!&rsquo; cried Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a bust to Longfellow, the American.&rsquo;&nbsp;
They read the inscription.&nbsp; &lsquo;This bust was placed
among the memorials of the poets of England by English admirers
of an American poet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so glad to have seen that.&nbsp; I know his poems
so well,&rsquo; said Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe he is more read than any poet in
England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is that standing figure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is Dryden.&nbsp; What a clever face, and what a
modern type.&nbsp; Here is Walter Scott beside the door.&nbsp;
How kindly and humorous his expression was!&nbsp; And see how
high his head was from the ear to the crown.&nbsp; It was a great
brain.&nbsp; There is Burns, the other famous Scot.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you think there is a resemblance between the
faces?&nbsp; And here are Dickens, and Thackeray, and
Macaulay.&nbsp; I wonder whether, when Macaulay was writing his
essays, he had a premonition that he would be buried in
Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; He is continually alluding to the Abbey
and its graves.&nbsp; I always think that we have a vague
intuition as to what will occur to us in life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can guess what is probable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It amounts to more than that.&nbsp; I had an intuition
that I should marry you from the first day that I saw you, and
yet it did not seem probable.&nbsp; But deep down in my soul I
knew that I should marry you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew that I should marry you, Frank, or else that I
should never marry at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There now!&nbsp; We both had it.&nbsp; Well, that
<i>is</i> really wonderful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They stood among the memorials of all those great people,
marvelling at the mysteries of their own small lives.&nbsp; A
voice at their elbows brought them back to the present.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This way, if you please, for the kings,&rsquo; said the
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;They are now starting for the
kings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo; proved to be a curiously mixed little group
of people who were waiting at the entrance through the enclosure
for the arrival of the official guide.&nbsp; There were a tall
red-bearded man with a very Scotch accent and a small gentle
wife, also an American father with his two bright and
enthusiastic daughters, a petty-officer of the navy in his
uniform, two young men whose attention was cruelly distracted
from the monuments by the American girls, and a dozen other
travellers of various sexes and ages.&nbsp; Just as Maude and
Frank joined them the guide, a young fresh-faced fellow, came
striding up, and they passed through the opening into the royal
burying-ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This way, ladies and gentlemen,&rsquo; cried the
hurrying guide, and they all clattered over the stone
pavement.&nbsp; He stopped beside a tomb upon which a lady with a
sad worn face was lying.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mary, Queen of
Scots,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the greatest beauty of her
day.&nbsp; This monument was erected by her son, James the
First.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t she just perfectly sweet?&rsquo; said one
of the American girls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I expected more of her
than that,&rsquo; the other answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I reckon,&rsquo; remarked the father, &lsquo;that if
any one went through as much as that lady did, it would not tend
to improve her beauty.&nbsp; Now what age might the lady be,
sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forty-four years of age at the time of her
execution,&rsquo; said the guide.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah weel, she&rsquo;s young for her years,&rsquo;
muttered the Scotchman, and the party moved on.&nbsp; Frank and
Maude lingered to have a further look at the unfortunate
princess, the bright French butterfly, who wandered from the
light and warmth into that grim country, a land of blood and of
psalms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was as hard as nails under all her gentle
grace,&rsquo; said Frank.&nbsp; &lsquo;She rode eighty miles and
hardly drew rein after the battle of Langside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She looks as if she were tired, poor dear!&rsquo; said
Maude; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think that she was sorry to be at
rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The guide was narrating the names of the owners of the tombs
at the further end of the chapel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Queen Anne is
here, and Mary the wife of William the Third is beside her.&nbsp;
And here is William himself.&nbsp; The king was very short and
the queen very tall, so in the sculptures the king is depicted
standing upon a stool so as to bring their heads level.&nbsp; In
the vaults beyond there are thirty-eight Stuarts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thirty-eight Stuarts!&nbsp; Princes, bishops, generals, once
the salt of the earth, the mightiest of men, and now lumped
carelessly together as thirty-eight Stuarts.&nbsp; So Death the
Republican and Time the Radical can drag down the highest from
his throne.</p>
<p>They had followed the guide into another small chapel, which
bore the name of Henry VII. upon the door.&nbsp; Surely they were
great builders and great designers in those days!&nbsp; Had stone
been as pliable as wax it could not have been twisted and curved
into more exquisite spirals and curls, so light, so delicate, so
beautiful, twining and turning along the walls, and drooping from
the ceiling.&nbsp; Never did the hand of man construct anything
more elaborately ornate, nor the brain of man think out a design
more absolutely harmonious and lovely.&nbsp; In the centre, with
all the pomp of medi&aelig;val heraldry, starred and spangled
with the Tudor badges, the two bronze figures of Henry and his
wife lay side by side upon their tomb.&nbsp; The guide read out
the quaint directions in the king&rsquo;s will, by which they
were to be buried &lsquo;with some respect to their Royal
dignity, but avoiding damnable pomp and outrageous
superfluities!&rsquo;&nbsp; There was, as Frank remarked, a fine
touch of the hot Tudor blood in the adjectives.&nbsp; One could
guess where Henry the Eighth got his masterful temper.&nbsp; Yet
it was an ascetic and priest-like face which looked upwards from
the tomb.</p>
<p>They passed the rifled tombs of Cromwell, Blake, and
Ireton&mdash;the despicable revenge of the men who did not dare
to face them in the field,&mdash;and they marked the grave of
James the First, who erected no monument to himself, and so
justified in death the reputation for philosophy which he had
aimed at in his life.&nbsp; Then they inspected the great tomb of
Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, as surprising and as magnificent as
his history, cast a glance at the covering of plucky little
George the Second, the last English king to lead his own army
into battle, and so onwards to see the corner of the Innocents,
where rest the slender bones of the poor children murdered in the
Tower.</p>
<p>But now the guide had collected his little flock around him
again, with the air of one who has something which is not to be
missed.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will stand upon the step to see the
profile,&rsquo; said he, as he indicated a female figure upon a
tomb.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is the great Queen Elizabeth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a profile and a face worth seeing&mdash;the face of a
queen who was worthy of her Shakespeares upon the land and her
Drakes upon the sea.&nbsp; Had the Spanish king seen her, he
would have understood that she was not safe to attack&mdash;this
grim old lady with the eagle nose and the iron lips.&nbsp; You
could understand her grip upon her cash-box, you could explain
her harshness to her lovers, you could realise the confidence of
her people, you could read it all in that wonderful face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s splendid,&rsquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s terrible,&rsquo; said Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I understand you to say, sir,&rsquo; asked the
American, &lsquo;that it was this lady who beheaded the other
lady, Queen of Scotland, whom we saw &rsquo;way back in the other
compartment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, she did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I guess if there was any beheading to be done,
this was the lady to see that it was put through with promptness
and despatch.&nbsp; Not a married lady, I gather?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a fortunate thing for somebody.&nbsp; That
woman&rsquo;s husband would have a mean time of it, sir, in my
opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, poppa,&rsquo; said the two daughters, and the
procession moved on.&nbsp; They were entering the inner chapel of
all, the oldest and the holiest, in which, amid the ancient
Plantagenet kings, there lies that one old Saxon monarch,
confessor and saint, the holy Edward, round whose honoured body
the whole of this great shrine has gradually risen.&nbsp; A
singular erection once covered with mosaic work, but now bare and
gaunt, stood in the centre.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The body of Edward the Confessor is in a case up at the
top,&rsquo; said the guide.&nbsp; &lsquo;This hollow place below
was filled with precious relics, and the pilgrims used to kneel
in these niches, which are just large enough to hold a man upon
his knees.&nbsp; The mosaic work has been picked out by the
pilgrims.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the date of the shrine?&rsquo; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About 1250, sir.&nbsp; The early kings were all buried
as near to it as they could get, for it was their belief in those
days that the devil might carry off the body, and so the nearer
they got to the shrine the safer they felt.&nbsp; Henry the
Fifth, who won the battle of Agincourt, is there.&nbsp; Those are
the actual helmet, shield, and saddle which he used in the battle
upon the crossbeam yonder.&nbsp; That king with the grave face
and the beard is Edward the Third, the father of the Black
Prince.&nbsp; The Black Prince never lived to ascend the throne,
but he was the father of the unfortunate Richard the Second, who
lies here&mdash;this clean-shaven king with the sharp
features.&nbsp; Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you will turn this
way, I will show you one of the most remarkable objects in the
Abbey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The object in question proved to be nothing more singular than
a square block of stone placed under an old chair.&nbsp; And yet
as the guide continued to speak, they felt that he had justified
his words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the sacred stone of Scone upon which the kings
of Scotland have been crowned from time immemorial.&nbsp; When
Edward the First overran Scotland 600 years ago, he had it
brought here, and since then every monarch of England has also
sat upon it when crowned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The present Queen?&rsquo; asked some one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she also.&nbsp; The legend was that it was the
stone upon which Jacob rested his head when he dreamed, but the
geologists have proved that it is red sandstone of
Scotland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I understand, sir, that this other throne is the
Scottish throne,&rsquo; said the American gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir, the Scottish throne and the English throne are
the same throne.&nbsp; But at the time of William and Mary it was
necessary to crown her as well as him, and so a second throne was
needed.&nbsp; But that of course was modern.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a couple of hundred years ago.&nbsp; I wonder they
let it in.&nbsp; But I guess they might have taken better care of
it.&nbsp; Some one has carved his name upon it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Westminster boy bet his schoolfellows that he would
sleep among the tombs, and to prove that he had done it, he
carved his name upon the throne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rsquo; cried the American.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, I guess that boy ended pretty high up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As high as the gallows, perhaps,&rsquo; said Frank, and
every one tittered, but the guide hurried on with a grave face,
for the dignity of the Abbey was in his keeping.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This tomb is that of Queen Eleanor,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>Frank twitched Maude by the sleeve.&nbsp; &lsquo;Eleanor of
Charing Cross,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;See how one little
bit of knowledge links on with another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And here is the tomb of her husband, Edward the
First.&nbsp; It was he who brought the stone from Scone.&nbsp; At
the time of his death the conquest of Scotland was nearly done,
and he gave orders that his burial should be merely temporary
until Scotland was thoroughly subdued.&nbsp; He is still, as you
perceive, in his temporary tomb.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The big Scotchman laughed loudly and derisively.&nbsp; All the
others looked sadly at him with the pitying gaze which the
English use towards the more excitable races when their emotion
gets the better of them.&nbsp; A stream from a garden hose could
not have damped him more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They opened the grave last century,&rsquo; said the
guide.&nbsp; &lsquo;Inside was an inscription, which said,
&ldquo;Here lies the hammer of the Scots.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a
fine man, six feet two inches from crown to sole.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They wandered out of the old shrine where the great
Plantagenet kings lie like a bodyguard round the Saxon
saint.&nbsp; Abbots lay on one side of them as they passed, and
dead crusaders with their legs crossed, upon the other.&nbsp; And
then, in an instant, they were back in comparatively modern times
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the tomb of Wolfe, who died upon the Heights of
Abraham,&rsquo; said the guide.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was due to him
and to his soldiers that all America belongs to the
English-speaking races.&nbsp; There is a picture of his
Highlanders going up to the battle along the winding path which
leads from Wolfe&rsquo;s Cove.&nbsp; He died in the moment of
victory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was bewildering, the way in which they skipped from age to
age.&nbsp; The history of England appeared to be not merely
continuous, but simultaneous, as they turned in an instant from
the Georgian to the Elizabethan, the one monument as well
preserved as the other.&nbsp; They passed the stately de Vere,
his armour all laid out in fragments upon a marble slab, as a
proof that he died at peace with all men; and they saw the
terrible statue of the onslaught of Death, which, viewed in the
moonlight, made a midnight robber drop his booty and fly
panic-stricken out of the Abbey.&nbsp; So awful and yet so
fascinating is it, that the shuffling feet of the party of
sightseers had passed out of hearing before Maude and Frank could
force themselves away from it.</p>
<p>In the base of the statue is an iron door, which has been
thrown open, and the sculptor&rsquo;s art has succeeded
wonderfully in convincing you that it has been thrown open
violently.&nbsp; The two leaves of it seem still to quiver with
the shock, and one could imagine that one heard the harsh clang
of the metal.&nbsp; Out of the black opening had sprung a
dreadful thing, something muffled in a winding-sheet, one bony
hand clutching the edge of the pedestal, the other upraised to
hurl a dart at the woman above him.&nbsp; She, a young bride of
twenty-seven, has fallen fainting, while her husband, with horror
in his face, is springing forward, his hand outstretched, to get
between his wife and her loathsome assailant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall dream of this,&rsquo; said Maude.&nbsp; She had
turned pale, as many a woman has before this monument.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is awful!&rsquo;&nbsp; Frank walked backwards,
unable to take his eyes from it.&nbsp; &lsquo;What pluck that
sculptor had!&nbsp; It is an effect which must be either
ludicrous or great, and he has made it great.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Roubillac is his name,&rsquo; said Maude, reading it
from the pedestal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Frenchman, or a man of French descent.&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t that characteristic!&nbsp; In the whole great Abbey
the one monument which has impressed us with its genius and
imagination is by a foreigner.&nbsp; We haven&rsquo;t got it in
us.&nbsp; We are too much afraid of letting ourselves go and of
giving ourselves away.&nbsp; We are heavy-handed and
heavy-minded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If we can&rsquo;t produce the monuments, we can produce
the men who deserve them,&rsquo; said Maude, and Frank wrote the
aphorism down upon his shirt-cuff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are too severe both in sculpture and
architecture,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;More fancy and vigour
in our sculptors, more use of gold and more ornament in our
architects&mdash;that is what we want.&nbsp; But I think it is
past praying for.&nbsp; It would be better to subdivide the work
of the world, according to the capacity of the different
nations.&nbsp; Let Italy and France embellish us.&nbsp; We might
do something in exchange&mdash;organise the French colonies,
perhaps, or the Italian exchequer.&nbsp; That is our legitimate
work, but we will never do anything at the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The guide had already reached the end of his round, an iron
gate corresponding to that by which they had entered, and they
found him waiting impatiently and swinging his keys.&nbsp; But
Maude&rsquo;s smile and word of thanks as she passed him brought
content into his face once more.&nbsp; A ray of living sunshine
is welcome to the man who spends his days among the tombs.</p>
<p>They walked down the North Transept and out through
Solomon&rsquo;s Porch.&nbsp; The rain-cloud had swept over, and
the summer sun was shining upon the wet streets, turning them all
to gold.&nbsp; This might have been that fabled London of which
young Whittington dreamed.&nbsp; In front of them lay the lawns
of vivid green, with the sunlit raindrops gleaming upon the
grass.&nbsp; The air was full of the chirping of the
sparrows.&nbsp; Across their vision, from the end of Whitehall to
Victoria Street, the black ribbon of traffic whirled and circled,
one of the great driving-belts of the huge city.&nbsp; Over it
all, to their right, towered those glorious Houses of Parliament,
the very sight of which made Frank repent his bitter words about
English architecture.&nbsp; They stood in the old porch gazing at
the scene.&nbsp; It was so wonderful to come back at one stride
from the great country of the past to the greater country of the
present.&nbsp; Here was the very thing which these dead men lived
and died to build.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not much past three,&rsquo; said
Frank.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a gloomy place to take you to!&nbsp;
Good heavens, we have one day together, and I take you to a
cemetery!&nbsp; Shall we go to a matin&eacute;e to counteract
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Maude laid her hand upon his arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think, Frank, that I was ever more
impressed, or learned more in so short a time, in my life.&nbsp;
It was a grand hour&mdash;an hour never to be forgotten.&nbsp;
And you must not think that I am ever with you to be
amused.&nbsp; I am with you to accompany you in whatever seems to
you to be highest and best.&nbsp; Now before we leave the dear
old Abbey, promise me that you will always live your own highest
and never come down to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can very safely promise that I will never come down
to you,&rsquo; said Frank.&nbsp; &lsquo;I may climb all my life,
and yet there are parts of your soul which will be like
snow-peaks in the clouds to me.&nbsp; But you will be now and
always my own dear comrade as well as my sweetest wife.&nbsp; And
now, Maude, what shall it be, the theatre or the
Australians?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you wish to go to either very much?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not unless you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I feel as if either would be a
profanation.&nbsp; Let us walk together down to the Embankment,
and sit on one of the benches there, and watch the river flowing
in the sunshine, and talk and think of all that we have
seen.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>TWO
SOLOS AND A DUET</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night before the wedding, Frank
Crosse and his best man, Rupton Hale, dined at the Raleigh Club
with Maude&rsquo;s brother, Jack Selby, who was a young
lieutenant in a Hussar regiment.&nbsp; Jack was a horsy, slangy
young sportsman who cared nothing about Frank&rsquo;s worldly
prospects, but had given the match his absolute approval from the
moment that he realised that his future brother had played for
the Surrey Second.&nbsp; &lsquo;What more can you want?&rsquo;
said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t exactly be a Mrs. W. G.,
but you will be on the edge of first-class cricket.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And Maude, who rejoiced in his approval, without quite
understanding the grounds for it, kissed him, and called him the
best of brothers.</p>
<p>The marriage was to be at eleven o&rsquo;clock at St.
Monica&rsquo;s Church, and the Selbys were putting up at the
Langham.&nbsp; Frank stayed at the Metropole, and so did Rupton
Hale.&nbsp; They were up early, their heads and nerves none the
better for Jack Selby&rsquo;s hospitality of the night
before.</p>
<p>Frank could eat no breakfast, and he shunned publicity in his
wedding-garments, so they remained in the upstairs
sitting-room.&nbsp; He stood by the window, drumming his fingers
upon the pane, and looking down into Northumberland Avenue.&nbsp;
He had often pictured this day, and associated it with sunshine
and flowers and every emblem of joy.&nbsp; But Nature had not
risen to the occasion.&nbsp; A thick vapour, half smoke half
cloud, drifted along the street, and a thin persistent rain was
falling steadily.&nbsp; It pit-patted upon the windows, splashed
upon the sills, and gurgled in the water-pipes.&nbsp; Far down
beneath him on the drab-coloured slimy road stood the lines of
wet cabs, looking like beetles with glistening backs.&nbsp; Round
black umbrellas hurried along the shining pavements.&nbsp; A
horse had fallen at the door of the Constitutional Club, and an
oil-skinned policeman was helping the cabman to raise it.&nbsp;
Frank watched it until the harness had been refastened, and it
had vanished into Trafalgar Square.&nbsp; Then he turned and
examined himself in the mirror.&nbsp; His trim black frock-coat
and pearl grey trousers set off his alert athletic figure to
advantage.&nbsp; His glossy hat, too, his lavender gloves, and
dark-blue tie, were all absolutely irreproachable.&nbsp; And yet
he was not satisfied with himself.&nbsp; Maude ought to have
something better than that.&nbsp; What a fool he had been to take
so much wine last night!&nbsp; On this day of all days in their
lives she surely had a right to find him at his best.&nbsp; He
was restless, and his nerves were all quivering.&nbsp; He would
have given anything for a cigarette, but he did not wish to scent
himself with tobacco.&nbsp; He had cut himself in shaving, and
his nose was peeling from a hot day on the cricket-field.&nbsp;
What a silly thing to expose his nose to the sun before his
wedding!&nbsp; Perhaps when Maude saw it she would&mdash;well,
she could hardly break it off, but at least she might be ashamed
of him.&nbsp; He worked himself into a fever over that
unfortunate nose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are off colour, Crosse,&rsquo; said his best
man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was just thinking that my nose was.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
very kind of you to come and stand by me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; We shall see it through
together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hale was a despondent man, though the most loyal of friends,
and he spoke in a despondent way.&nbsp; His gloomy manner, the
London drizzle, and the nervousness proper to the occasion, were
all combining to make Frank more and more wretched.&nbsp;
Fortunately Jack Selby burst like a gleam of sunshine into the
room.&nbsp; The sight of his fresh-coloured smiling face&mdash;or
it may have been some reminder of Maude which he found in
it&mdash;brought consolation to the bridegroom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How are you, Crosse?&nbsp; How do, Hale?&nbsp; Excuse
my country manners!&nbsp; The old Christmas-tree in the hall
wanted to send for you, but I knew your number.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re looking rather green about the gills, old
chap.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel a little chippy to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of these cheap champagnes.&nbsp;
Late hours are bad for the young.&nbsp; Have a whisky and soda
with me.&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Hale, you must buck him up, for
they&rsquo;ll all be down on you if you don&rsquo;t bring your
man up to time in the pink of condition.&nbsp; We certainly did
ourselves up to the top hole last night.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t
face your breakfast, eh?&nbsp; Neither could I.&nbsp; A
strawberry and a bucket of soda-water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How are they all at the Langham?&rsquo; asked Frank
eagerly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, splendid!&nbsp; At least I haven&rsquo;t seen
Maude.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s been getting into parade order.&nbsp;
But mother is full of beans.&nbsp; We had to take her up one link
in the curb, or there would have been no holding her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank&rsquo;s eyes kept turning to the slow-moving
minute-hand.&nbsp; It was not ten o&rsquo;clock yet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that I might go round to the
Langham and see them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good Lord, no!&nbsp; Clean against regulations.&nbsp;
Stand by his head, Hale!&nbsp; Wo, boy, steady!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Crosse, it really
won&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said Hale solemnly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What rot it is!&nbsp; Here am I doing nothing, and I
might be of some use or encouragement to her.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s
get a cab!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wo, laddie, wo then, boy!&nbsp; Keep him in hand,
Hale!&nbsp; Get to his head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank flung himself down into an armchair, and muttered about
absurd conventions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped, my boy.&nbsp; It is
correct.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Buck up, Crosse, buck up!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll make the
thing go with a buzz when we do begin.&nbsp; Two of our Johnnies
are coming, regular fizzers, and full of blood both of
them.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll paint the Langham a fine bright
solferino, when the church parade is over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank sat rather sulkily watching the slow minute-hand, and
listening to the light-hearted chatter of the boy-lieutenant, and
the more deliberate answers of his best man.&nbsp; At last he
jumped up and seized his hat and gloves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Half-past,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come on.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t wait any longer.&nbsp; I must do
<i>something</i>.&nbsp; It is time we went to the
church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fall in for the church!&rsquo; cried Jack.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wait a bit!&nbsp; I know this game, for I was best man
myself last month.&nbsp; Inspect his kit, Hale.&nbsp; See that
he&rsquo;s according to regulations.&nbsp; Ring?&nbsp; All
right.&nbsp; Parson&rsquo;s money?&nbsp; Right oh!&nbsp; Small
change?&nbsp; Good!&nbsp; By the right, quick march!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank soon recovered his spirits now that he had something to
do.&nbsp; Even that drive through the streaming streets, with the
rain pattering upon the top of their four-wheeler, could not
depress him any longer.&nbsp; He rose to the level of Jack Selby,
and they chattered gaily together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t we bringing him up fighting fit?&rsquo;
cried Jack exultingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shows that all the care we
have taken of him in the last twenty-four hours has not been
wasted.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the sort I like&mdash;game as a
pebble!&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t buy &rsquo;em, you have to breed
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; A regular fizzer <i>he</i> is, and full of
blood.&nbsp; And here we are on the ground.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a low, old-fashioned, grey church, with a Gothic
entrance and two niches on either side, which spoke of
pre-Lutheran days.&nbsp; Cheap modern shops, which banked it in,
showed up the quaint dignity of the ancient front.&nbsp; The
side-door was open, and they passed into its dim-lit interior,
with high carved pews, and rich, old, stained glass.&nbsp; Huge
black oak beams curved over their heads, and dim inscriptions of
medi&aelig;val Latin curled and writhed upon the walls.&nbsp; A
single step seemed to have taken them from the atmosphere of the
nineteenth to that of the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a ripping old church!&rsquo; Jack whispered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t buy &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s as
festive as an ice-house.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a friendly native
coming down the aisle.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s your man, Hale, if you
want the news.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The verger was not in the best of tempers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s at a quarter to four,&rsquo; said he, as Hale
met him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, at eleven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quarter to four, I tell you.&nbsp; The vicar says
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s not possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have them at all hours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Buryin&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But this is a marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I beg your pardon, sir.&nbsp; I thought
when I looked at you as you was the party about the child&rsquo;s
funeral.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heavens, no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was something in your expression, sir, but now that
I can see the colour of your clothes, why of course I know
better.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s three marriages&mdash;which was
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Crosse and Selby are the names.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The verger consulted an old crumpled notebook.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, I have it here.&nbsp; Mr. or Miss Crosse to
Mr. or Miss Selby.&nbsp; Eleven o&rsquo;clock, sir,
<i>sharp</i>.&nbsp; The vicar&rsquo;s a terrible punctual man,
and I should advise you to take your places.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Any hitch?&rsquo; asked Frank nervously, as Hale
returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was he talking about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, nothing.&nbsp; Some little confusion of
ideas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we go up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I think that we had better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their steps clattered and reverberated through the empty
church as they passed up the aisle.&nbsp; They stood in an
aimless way before the altar rails.&nbsp; Frank fidgeted about,
and made sure that the ring was in his ticket-pocket.&nbsp; He
also took a five-pound note and placed it where he knew he could
lay his hands upon it easily.&nbsp; Then he sprang round with a
flush upon his cheeks, for one of the side-doors had been flung
open with a great bustle and clanging.&nbsp; A stout charwoman
entered with a tin pail and a mop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put up the wrong bird that time,&rsquo; whispered Jack,
and sniggered at Frank&rsquo;s change of expression.</p>
<p>But almost at the same instant, the Selbys entered the church
at the further end.&nbsp; Mr. Selby, with his red face and fluffy
side-whiskers, had Maude upon his arm.&nbsp; She looked very pale
and very sweet, with downcast eyes and solemn mouth, while behind
her walked her younger sister Mary and her pretty friend Nelly
Sheridan, both in pink dresses with broad pink hats and white
curling feathers.&nbsp; The bride was herself in the grey
travelling-dress with which Frank was already familiar by its
description in her letter.&nbsp; Its gentle tint and her tenderly
grave expression made a charming effect.&nbsp; Behind them was
the mother, still young and elegant, with something of
Maude&rsquo;s grace in her figure and carriage.&nbsp; As the
party came up the aisle, Frank was to be restrained no
longer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get to his head!&rsquo; cried Jack to Hale
in an excited whisper, but their man was already hurrying to
shake hands with Maude.&nbsp; He walked up on her right, and they
took their position in two little groups, the happy couple in the
centre.&nbsp; At the same moment the clang of the church-clock
sounded above them, and the vicar, shrugging his shoulders to get
his white surplice into position, came bustling out of the
vestry.&nbsp; To him it was all the most usual, commonplace, and
unimportant thing in the world, and both Frank and Maude were
filled with amazement at the nonchalant way in which he whipped
out a prayer-book, and began to rapidly perform the
ceremony.&nbsp; It was all so new and solemn and all-important to
them, that they had expected something mystic and overpowering in
the function, and yet here was this brisk little man, with an
obvious cold in his head, tying them up in as business-like a
fashion as a grocer uniting two parcels.&nbsp; After all, he had
to do it a thousand times a year, and so he could not be
extravagant in his emotions.</p>
<p>The singular service was read out to them, the exhortations,
and the explanations, sometimes stately, sometimes beautiful,
sometimes odious.&nbsp; Then the little vicar turned upon
Frank&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded
wife</i>, <i>to live together after God&rsquo;s ordinance in the
holy estate of matrimony</i>?&nbsp; <i>Wilt thou love her</i>,
<i>comfort her</i>, <i>honour her</i>, <i>in sickness and in
health</i>, <i>and forsaking all other</i>, <i>keep thee only
unto her as long as ye both shall live</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I will</i>,&rsquo; cried Frank, with conviction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>And wilt thou have this man to thy wedded
husband</i>, <i>to live together after God&rsquo;s ordinance in
the holy estate of matrimony</i>?&nbsp; <i>Wilt thou obey
him</i>, <i>and serve him</i>, <i>love</i>, <i>honour</i>, <i>and
keep him</i>, <i>in sickness and in health</i>, <i>and forsaking
all other</i>, <i>keep thee only unto him so long as ye both
shall live</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I will</i>,&rsquo; said Maude, from her heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Who giveth this woman to be married to this
man</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I do</i>.&nbsp; Mr. John Selby&mdash;her father, you
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then in turn they repeated the fateful
words&mdash;&lsquo;<i>I take thee to have and to hold from this
day forward</i>, <i>for better</i>, <i>for worse</i>, <i>for
richer</i>, <i>for poorer</i>, <i>in sickness and in health</i>,
<i>to love</i>, <i>cherish</i>, <i>and obey</i>, <i>till death us
do part</i>, <i>according to God&rsquo;s holy ordinance</i>,
<i>and thereto I give thee my troth</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ring!&nbsp; Ring!&rsquo; said Hale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ring, you Juggins!&rsquo; whispered Jack Selby.</p>
<p>Frank thrust his hands frantically into all his pockets.&nbsp;
The ring was in the last one which he attempted.&nbsp; But the
bank-note was not to be found.&nbsp; He remembered that he had
put it in some safe place.&nbsp; Where could it have been?&nbsp;
Was it in his boot, or in the lining of his hat?&nbsp; No, surely
he could not have done anything so infatuated.&nbsp; Again he
took his pockets two at a time, while a dreadful pause came in
the ceremony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vestry&mdash;afterwards,&rsquo; whispered the
clergyman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here you are!&rsquo; gasped Frank.&nbsp; He had come
upon it in a last desperate dive into his watch-pocket, in which
he never by any chance kept anything.&nbsp; Of course it was for
that very reason, that it might be alone and accessible, that he
had placed it there.&nbsp; Ring and note were handed to the
vicar, who deftly concealed the one and returned the other.&nbsp;
Then Maude&rsquo;s little white hand was outstretched, and over
the third finger Frank slipped the circlet of gold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>With this ring I thee wed</i>,&rsquo; said Frank,
&lsquo;<i>and with my body I thee worship</i> (he paused, and
made a mental emendation of &lsquo;with my soul also&rsquo;),
<i>and with all my worldly goods I thee endow</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a prayer, and then the vicar joined the two hands,
the muscular sunburned one and the dainty white one, with the new
ring gleaming upon it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Those whom God hath joined together</i>, <i>let no
man put asunder</i>,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Forasmuch as
Francis Crosse and Maude Selby have consented together in holy
wedlock</i>, <i>and have witnessed the same before God and this
company</i>, <i>and thereto have given and pledged their
troth</i>, <i>either to other</i>, <i>and have declared the same
by giving and receiving of a ring</i>, <i>and by joining of
hands; I pronounce that they be man and wife
together</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There now, it was done!&nbsp; They were one, never more to
part until the coffin-lid closed over one or the other.&nbsp;
They were kneeling together now, and the vicar was rapidly
repeating some psalms and prayers.&nbsp; But Frank&rsquo;s mind
was not with the ritual.&nbsp; He looked slantwise at the
graceful, girlish figure by his side.&nbsp; Her hair hung
beautifully over her white neck, and the reverent droop of her
head was lovely to his eyes.&nbsp; So gentle, so humble, so good,
so beautiful, and all his, his sworn life-companion for
ever!&nbsp; A gush of tenderness flowed through his heart for
her.&nbsp; His love had always been passionate, but, for the
instant, it was heroic, tremendous in its unselfishness.&nbsp;
Might he bring her happiness, the highest which woman could wish
for!&nbsp; God grant that he might do so!&nbsp; But if he were to
make her unhappy, or to take anything from her beauty and her
goodness, then he prayed that he might die now, at this supreme
moment, kneeling at her side before the altar rails.&nbsp; So
intense was his prayer that he looked up expectantly at the
altar, as if in the presence of an imminent catastrophe.&nbsp;
But every one had risen to their feet, and the service was at an
end.&nbsp; The vicar led the way, and they all followed him, into
the vestry.&nbsp; There was a general murmur all round them of
congratulation and approval.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heartiest congratulations, Crosse!&rsquo; said
Hale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bravo, Maude, you looked ripping!&rsquo; cried Jack,
kissing his sister.&nbsp; &lsquo;By Jove, it simply went with a
buzz from the word &ldquo;go.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You sign it here and here,&rsquo; said the vicar,
&lsquo;and the witnesses here and here.&nbsp; Thank you very
much.&nbsp; I am sure that I wish you every happiness.&nbsp; I
need not detain you by any further formality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so, with a curious dream-like feeling, Frank Crosse and
Maude found themselves walking down the aisle, he very proud and
erect, she very gentle and shy, while the organ thundered the
wedding-march.&nbsp; Carriages were waiting: he handed in his
wife, stepped in after her, and they drove off, amidst a murmur
of sympathy from a little knot of idlers who had gathered in the
porch, partly from curiosity, and partly to escape the rain.</p>
<p>Maude had often driven alone with Frank before, but now she
felt suddenly constrained and shy.&nbsp; The marriage-service,
with all its half-understood allusions and exhortations, had
depressed and frightened her.&nbsp; She hardly dared to glance at
her husband.&nbsp; But he soon led her out of her graver
humour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Name, please?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Name, if <i>you</i> please?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maude Crosse&mdash;O Frank!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You blessing!&nbsp; How grand it sounds!&nbsp; O Maude,
what a jolly old world it is!&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it pretty to see
the rain falling?&nbsp; And aren&rsquo;t the shining pavements
lovely?&nbsp; And isn&rsquo;t everything splendid, and am I not
the luckiest&mdash;the most incredibly lucky of men.&nbsp; Dear
girlie, give me your hand!&nbsp; I can feel <i>it</i> under the
glove.&nbsp; Now, sweetheart, you are not frightened, are
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I was a little.&nbsp; O Frank, you won&rsquo;t
tire of me, will you?&nbsp; I should break my heart if you
did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tire of you!&nbsp; Good heavens!&nbsp; Now you&rsquo;ll
never guess what I was doing while the parson was telling us
about what Saint Paul said to the Colossians, and all the rest of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know perfectly well what you were doing.&nbsp; And
you shouldn&rsquo;t have done it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was I doing, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were staring at me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you saw that, did you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I felt it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I was.&nbsp; But I was praying also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you, Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I saw you kneeling there, so sweet and pure and
good, I seemed to realise how you had been given into my keeping
for life, and I prayed with all my heart that if I should ever
injure you in thought, or word, or deed, I might drop dead now
before I had time to do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, what a dreadful prayer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I felt it and I wished it, and I could not help
it.&nbsp; My own darling, there you are just a living angel, the
gentlest, most sensitive, and beautiful living creature that
walks the earth, and please God I shall keep you so, and ever
higher and higher if such a thing is possible, and if ever I say
a word or do a deed that seems to lower you, then remind me of
this moment, and send me back to try to live up to our highest
ideal again.&nbsp; And I for my part will try to improve myself
and to live up to you, and to bridge more and more the gap that
is between us, that I may feel myself not altogether unworthy of
our love.&nbsp; And so we shall act and re-act upon each other,
ever growing better and wiser, and dating what is best and
brightest in our minds and souls from the day that we were
married.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s <i>my</i> idea of a
marriage-service, and here endeth the first lesson, and the
windows are blurred with rain, and hang the coachman, and
it&rsquo;s hard lines if a man may not kiss his own
wife&mdash;you blessing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A broad-brimmed hat with a curling feather is not a good shape
for driving with an ardent young bridegroom in a discreetly
rain-blurred carriage.&nbsp; Frank demonstrated the fact, and it
took them all the way to the Langham to get those pins driven
home again.&nbsp; And then after an abnormal meal, which was
either a very late breakfast or a very early lunch, they drove on
to Victoria Station, from which they were to start for
Brighton.&nbsp; Jack Selby and the two regimental fizzers, who
had secured immortality for the young couple, if the deep and
constant drinking of healths could have done it, had provided
themselves with packages of rice, old slippers, and other
time-honoured missiles.&nbsp; On a hint from Maude, however, that
she would prefer a quiet departure, Frank coaxed the three back
into the luncheon-room with a perfectly guileless face, and then
locking the door on the outside, handed the key and a
half-sovereign to the head-waiter, with instructions to release
the prisoners when the carriage had gone&mdash;an incident which
in itself would cause the judicious observer to think that, given
the opportunity, Mister Frank Crosse had it in him to go pretty
far in life.&nbsp; And so, quietly and soberly, they rolled away
upon their first journey&mdash;the journey which was the opening
of that life&rsquo;s journey, the goal of which no man may
see.</p>
<h2><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>KEEPING UP APPEARANCES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the roomy dining-room of
the Hotel Metropole at Brighton.&nbsp; Maude and Frank were
seated at the favourite small round table near the window, where
they always lunched.&nbsp; Their immediate view was a snowy-white
tablecloth with a shining centre dish of foppish little cutlets,
each with a wisp of ornamental paper, and a surrounding bank of
mashed potatoes.&nbsp; Beyond, from the very base of the window,
as it seemed, there stretched the huge expanse of the deep blue
sea, its soothing mass of colour broken only by a few white
leaning sails upon the furthest horizon.&nbsp; Along the sky-line
the white clouds lay in carelessly piled cumuli, like snow thrown
up from a clearing.&nbsp; It was restful and beautiful, that
distant view, but just at the moment it was the near one which
interested them most.&nbsp; Though they lose from this moment
onwards the sympathy of every sentimental reader, the truth must
be told that they were thoroughly enjoying their lunch.</p>
<p>With the wonderful adaptability of women&mdash;a hereditary
faculty, which depends upon the fact that from the beginning of
time the sex has been continually employed in making the best of
situations which were not of their own choosing&mdash;Maude
carried off her new character easily and gracefully.&nbsp; In her
trim blue serge dress and sailor hat, with the warm tint of
yesterday&rsquo;s sun upon her cheeks, she was the very picture
of happy and healthy womanhood.&nbsp; Frank was also in a blue
serge boating-suit, which was appropriate enough, for they spent
most of their time upon the water, as a glance at his hands would
tell.&nbsp; Their conversation was unhappily upon a very much
lower plane than when we overheard them last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got such an appetite!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So have I, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Capital.&nbsp; Have another cutlet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Potatoes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always thought that people on their honeymoon lived
on love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it dreadful, Frank?&nbsp; We must be
so material.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good old mother Nature!&nbsp; Cling on to her skirt and
you never lose your way.&nbsp; One wants a healthy physical basis
for a healthy spiritual emotion.&nbsp; Might I trouble you for
the pickles?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you happy, Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Absolutely and completely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite, <i>quite</i> sure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never was quite so sure of anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It makes me so happy to hear you say so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, I am just floating upon golden clouds in a
dream.&nbsp; But your poor hands!&nbsp; Oh, how they must pain
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was that heavy oar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I get no practice at rowing.&nbsp; There is no place to
row in at Woking, unless one used the canal.&nbsp; But it was
worth a blister or two.&nbsp; By Jove, wasn&rsquo;t it splendid,
coming back in the moonlight with that silver lane flickering on
the water in front of us?&nbsp; We were so completely
alone.&nbsp; We might have been up in the interstellar spaces,
you and I, travelling from Sirius to Arcturus in one of those
profound gulfs of the void which Hardy talks about.&nbsp; It was
overpowering.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can never forget it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll go again to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the blisters!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hang the blisters!&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ll take some bait
with us and try to catch something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What fun!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And we&rsquo;ll drive to Rottingdean this afternoon, if
you feel inclined.&nbsp; Have this last cutlet, dear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it seems a pity to waste it.&nbsp; Here
goes!&nbsp; By the way, Maude, I must speak very severely to
you.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t if you look at me like that.&nbsp; But
really, joking apart, you must be more careful before the
waiters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we have carried it off splendidly so far.&nbsp;
No one has found us out yet, and no one will if we are reasonably
careful.&nbsp; The fat waiter is convinced that we are
veterans.&nbsp; But last night at dinner you very nearly gave the
thing away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I, Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look so sweetly penitent, you
blessing.&nbsp; The fact is that you make a shocking bad
conspirator.&nbsp; Now I have a kind of talent for that, as I
have for every other sort of depravity, so it will be pretty safe
in my hands.&nbsp; You are as straight as a line by nature, and
you can&rsquo;t be crooked when you try.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what did I say?&nbsp; Oh, I <i>am</i> so
sorry!&nbsp; I tried to be so careful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, about the curry, you know.&nbsp; It was an error
of judgment to ask if I took chutnee.&nbsp; And then . . .
&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About the boots.&nbsp; Did I get them in London or
Woking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear, dear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not another!&nbsp; O Frank!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the use of the word &ldquo;my.&rdquo;&nbsp; You
must give that word up.&nbsp; It should be
&ldquo;our.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know, I know.&nbsp; It was when I said that the salt
water had taken the curl out of the feather in my&mdash;no, in
our&mdash;well, in <i>the</i> hat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was all right.&nbsp; But it is <i>our</i> luggage,
you know, and <i>our</i> room, and so on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course it is.&nbsp; How foolish I am!&nbsp; Then the
waiter knows!&nbsp; O Frank, what shall we do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not he.&nbsp; He knows nothing.&nbsp; I am sure of
it.&nbsp; He is a dull sort of person.&nbsp; I had my eye on him
all the time.&nbsp; Besides, I threw in a few remarks just to set
the thing right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was when you spoke about our travels in the
Tyrol?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, how <i>could</i> you?&nbsp; And you said how
lonely it was when we were the only visitors at the Swiss
hotel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was an inspiration.&nbsp; That finished
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And about the closeness of the Atlantic
staterooms.&nbsp; I blushed to hear you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he listened eagerly to it all.&nbsp; I could see
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder if he really believed it.&nbsp; I have noticed
that the maids and the waiters seem to look at us with a certain
interest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear girlie, you will find as you go through life
that every man will always look at you with a certain
interest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude smiled, but was unconvinced.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cheese, dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A little butter, please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some butter, waiter, and the Stilton.&nbsp; You know
the real fact is, that we make the mistake of being much too nice
to each other in public.&nbsp; Veterans don&rsquo;t do
that.&nbsp; They take the small courtesies for
granted&mdash;which is all wrong, but it shows that they
<i>are</i> veterans.&nbsp; That is where we give ourselves
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That never occurred to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you want to settle that waiter for ever, and remove
the last lingering doubt from his mind, the thing is for you to
be rude to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or you to me, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure you won&rsquo;t mind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, hang it, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;not even for so good
an object.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I can&rsquo;t either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But this is absurd.&nbsp; It is only acting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite so.&nbsp; It is only fun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why won&rsquo;t you do it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be back before we settle it.&nbsp; Look
here!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a shilling under my hand.&nbsp; Heads or
tails, and the loser has to be rude.&nbsp; Do you
agree?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your call.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heads.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s tails.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh goodness!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be rude.&nbsp; Now mind you
are.&nbsp; Here he comes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The waiter had come up the room bearing the pride of the
hotel, the grand green Stilton with the beautiful autumn leaf
heart shading away to rich plum-coloured cavities.&nbsp; He
placed it on the table with a solemn air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful Stilton,&rsquo; Frank
remarked.</p>
<p>Maude tried desperately to be rude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, dear, I don&rsquo;t think it is so very
beautiful,&rsquo; was the best that she could do.</p>
<p>It was not much, but it had a surprising effect upon the
waiter.&nbsp; He turned and hurried away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There now, you&rsquo;ve shocked him?&rsquo; cried
Frank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where <i>has</i> he gone, Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To complain to the management about your
language.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Frank.&nbsp; Please tell me!&nbsp; Oh, I wish I
hadn&rsquo;t been so rude.&nbsp; Here he is again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right.&nbsp; Sit tight,&rsquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>A sort of procession was streaming up the hall.&nbsp; There
was their fat waiter in front with a large covered
cheese-dish.&nbsp; Behind him was another with two smaller ones,
and a third with some yellow powder upon a plate was bringing up
the rear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is Gorgonzola, main,&rsquo; said the waiter, with
a severe manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;And there&rsquo;s Camembert and
Gruy&egrave;re behind, and powdered Parmesan as well.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sorry that the Stilton don&rsquo;t give
satisfaction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude helped herself to Gorgonzola and looked very guilty and
uncomfortable.&nbsp; Frank began to laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I meant you to be rude to <i>me</i>, not to the
cheese,&rsquo; said he, when the procession had withdrawn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did my best, Frank.&nbsp; I contradicted
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it was a shocking display of temper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I hurt the poor waiter&rsquo;s feelings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll have to apologise to his Stilton
before he will forgive you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I don&rsquo;t believe he is a bit more convinced
that we are veterans than he was before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, dear; leave him to me.&nbsp; Those
reminiscences of mine must have settled him.&nbsp; If they
didn&rsquo;t, then I feel it is hopeless.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was as well for his peace of mind that Frank could not hear
the conversation between the fat waiter and their chambermaid,
for whom he nourished a plethoric attachment.&nbsp; They had half
an hour off in the afternoon, and were comparing notes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nice-lookin&rsquo; couple, ain&rsquo;t they,
John?&rsquo; said the maid, with the air of an expert.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know as we&rsquo;ve &lsquo;ad a better since
the spring weddin&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;d go as far as
that,&rsquo; said the fat waiter critically.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;d pass all right.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;s an
upstandin&rsquo; young man with a good sperrit in
&rsquo;im.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with &rsquo;er, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of opinion,&rsquo; said the
waiter.&nbsp; &lsquo;I likes &rsquo;em a bit more full-flavoured
myself.&nbsp; And as to &rsquo;er taste, why there, if you
&rsquo;ad seen &rsquo;er turn up &rsquo;er nose at the Stilton at
lunch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Turn up &rsquo;er nose, did she?&nbsp; Well, she seemed
to me a very soft-spoken, obligin&rsquo; young lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So she may be, but they&rsquo;re a queer couple, I tell
you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as well they are married at
last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because they &rsquo;ave been goin&rsquo; on most
owdacious before&rsquo;and.&nbsp; I &rsquo;ave it from their own
lips, and it fairly made me blush to listen to it.&nbsp; Awful,
it was, <i>awful</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say that, John!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you, Jane, I couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ardly believe
my ears.&nbsp; They was married on Tuesday last, as we know well,
and to-day&rsquo;s <i>Times</i> to prove it, and yet if
you&rsquo;ll believe me, they was talkin&rsquo; about &rsquo;ow
they &rsquo;ad travelled alone abroad&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, John!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And alone in a Swiss &rsquo;otel!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My goodness!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a steamer too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, there!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never trust any one
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, a perfec&rsquo; pair of scorchers.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ll let &rsquo;im see as I knows it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll put
that <i>Times</i> before &rsquo;im to-night at dinner as sure as
my name&rsquo;s John.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a good lesson to them, too!&nbsp; If you
didn&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;d &rsquo;eard it from their own lips,
John, I never could &rsquo;ave believed it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
things like that as shakes your trust in &rsquo;uman
nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude and Frank were lingering at the <i>table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> over their walnuts and a glass of port
wine, when their waiter came softly behind them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beg pardon, sir, but did you see it in the
<i>Times</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;See what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>That</i>, sir.&nbsp; I thought that it might be of
interest to you and to your good lady to see it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had laid one page of the paper before them, with his
forefinger upon an item in the left-hand top corner.&nbsp; Then
he discreetly withdrew.&nbsp; Frank stared at it in horror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maude, your people have gone and put it in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our marriage!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here it is!&nbsp; Listen!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Crosse&mdash;Selby.&nbsp; 30th June, at St. Monica&rsquo;s
Church, by the Rev. John Tudwell, M.A., Vicar of St.
Monica&rsquo;s, Frank Crosse, of Maybury Road, Woking, to Maude
Selby, eldest daughter of Robert Selby, Esq., of St.
Albans.&rdquo;&nbsp; Great Scot, Maude! what shall we
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, dear, does it matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Matter!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s simply awful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind much if they do know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But my reminiscences, Maude!&nbsp; The travels in the
Tyrol!&nbsp; The Swiss Hotel!&nbsp; The Stateroom!&nbsp; Great
goodness, how I have put my foot into it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You old dear!&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe you are a bit better as a conspirator than I am.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s only one thing you can do.&nbsp; Give the waiter
half a crown, tell him the truth, and don&rsquo;t conspire any
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so ignominiously ended the attempt which so many have
made, and at which so many have failed.&nbsp; Take warning,
gentle reader, and you also, gentler reader still, when your own
turn comes.</p>
<h2><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>THE
HOME-COMING</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> days of holiday were over, and
for each of them the duties of life were waiting.&nbsp; For him
it was his work, and for her, her housekeeping.&nbsp; They both
welcomed the change, for there was a rush and a want of privacy
about the hotel life which had been amusing at first, but was now
becoming irksome.&nbsp; It was pleasant, as they rolled out of
Waterloo Station that summer night, to know that their cosy
little home was awaiting them just five-and-twenty miles down the
line.&nbsp; They had a first-class carriage to
themselves&mdash;it is astonishing how easy it is for two people
to fit into one of those armchair partitions,&mdash;and they
talked all the way down about their plans for the future.&nbsp;
Golden visions of youth, how they can glorify even a suburban
villa and four hundred a year!&nbsp; They exulted together over
the endless vista of happy days which stretched before them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Watson, Frank&rsquo;s trusty housekeeper, had been left
in charge of The Lindens, and he had sent her a telegram the
evening before to tell her that they were coming.&nbsp; She had
already engaged the two servants, so everything would be ready
for them.&nbsp; They pictured her waiting at the door, the neat
little rooms with all their useful marriage-presents in their
proper places, the lamplight and the snowy cloth laid for supper
in the dining-room.&nbsp; It would be ten o&rsquo;clock before
they got there, and that supper would be a welcome sight.&nbsp;
It was all delightful to look forward to, and this last journey
was the happiest of all their wanderings.&nbsp; Maude wanted to
see her kitchen.&nbsp; Frank wanted to see his books.&nbsp; Both
were eager for the fight.</p>
<p>But they found a small annoyance waiting for them at
Woking.&nbsp; A crowded train had preceded them, and there was
not a single cab left at the station.&nbsp; Some would be back
soon, but nobody could tell when.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mind walking, Maude?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should prefer it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So a friendly porter took charge of their trunks, and promised
to send them up when a conveyance had arrived.&nbsp; In the
meantime they started off together down an ill-lit and ill-kept
road, which opened into that more important thoroughfare in which
their own villa was situated.&nbsp; They walked quickly, full of
eager anticipations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s just past the third lamp-post on the
right,&rsquo; said Frank.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s only the
second lamp-post.&nbsp; You see it will not be far from the
station.&nbsp; Those windows among the trees are where Hale
lives&mdash;my best man, you know!&nbsp; Now it is only one
lamp-post!&rsquo;&nbsp; They quickened their pace almost to a
run, and so arrived at the gate of The Lindens.</p>
<p>It was a white gate leading into a short
path&mdash;&lsquo;carriage sweep&rsquo; the house-agent called
it,&mdash;and so to a low but comfortable-looking little
house.&nbsp; The night was so dark that one could only see its
outline.&nbsp; To their surprise, there was no sign of a light
either above the door or at any of the windows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blessed!&rsquo; cried Frank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, dear.&nbsp; They live at the back, no
doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I gave them the hour.&nbsp; This is too bad.&nbsp;
I am so sorry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be all the more cosy inside.&nbsp; What a dear
little gate this is!&nbsp; The whole place is perfectly
charming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But in spite of her brave attempts at making the best of it,
it could not be denied that this black house was not what they
had pictured in their dreams.&nbsp; Frank strode angrily up the
path and pulled at the bell.&nbsp; There was no answer, so he
knocked violently.&nbsp; Then he knocked with one hand while he
rang with the other, but no sound save that of the clanging bell
came from the gloomy house.&nbsp; As they stood forlornly in
front of their own hall-door, a soft rain began to rustle amidst
the bushes.&nbsp; At this climax of their troubles Maude burst
into such a quiet, hearty, irresistible fit of laughter, that the
angry Frank was forced to laugh also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My word, it will be no laughing matter for Mrs. Watson
if she cannot give a good reason for it,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps the poor woman is ill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there should be two other people, the cook and the
housemaid.&nbsp; It is just as well that we did not bring up our
trunks, or we should have had to dump them down in the front
garden.&nbsp; You wait here, dear, under the shelter of the
porch, and I will walk round and see if I can burgle
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He tried the back, but it was as dark as the front, and the
kitchen-door was locked.&nbsp; Then he prowled unhappily in the
rain from window to window.&nbsp; They were all fastened.&nbsp;
He came back to the kitchen-door, poked his stick through the
glass which formed the upper panel, and then putting his hand
through the hole, he turned the key, and so stumbled into the
obscurity of his own hall.&nbsp; He passed through it, unlocked
the front door, and received Maude into his open arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Welcome to your home, my own darling girl.&nbsp; May
you never have one sad hour under this roof!&nbsp; What a dismal
home-coming!&nbsp; What can I do to make amends?&nbsp; But good
comes out of evil, you see, for in no other possible way could I
have been inside to welcome you when you entered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They stayed in the hall in the dark some time, these wet and
foolish young people.&nbsp; Then Frank struck a match, and tried
to light the hall-lamp.&nbsp; There was no oil in it.&nbsp; He
muttered something vigorous, and carried his burning vesta into
the dining-room.&nbsp; Two candles were standing on the
sideboard.&nbsp; He lit them both, and things began to look a
little more cheerful.&nbsp; They took a candle each and began to
explore their own deserted house.</p>
<p>The dining-room was excellent&mdash;small, but very
snug.&nbsp; The Tantalus spirit-stand&mdash;stood upon the walnut
sideboard, and the bronzes from the cricket-club looked splendid
upon each side of the mantelpiece.&nbsp; Beside the clock in the
centre lay an open telegram.&nbsp; Frank seized it eagerly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There now!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Listen to
this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Expect us on Thursday evening about
ten.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was <i>Tuesday</i> evening, I said.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the telegraphic clerk.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve come two
days before our time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was good to have any sort of explanation, although it left
a great deal unexplained.&nbsp; They passed through the hall with
its shining linoleum, and into the drawing-room.&nbsp; It was not
a very good room, too square for elegance, but they were in no
humour for criticism, and it was charming to see all the old
knick-knacks, and the photographs of friends in their
frames.&nbsp; A big wrought-iron and brass-work standing lamp
towered up near the fireplace, but again there was no oil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think that Mrs. Watson has arranged it all
splendidly,&rsquo; said Maude, whose active fingers were already
beginning to reconstruct.&nbsp; &lsquo;But where can she
be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must be out, for, of course, she lives in the
house.&nbsp; But it is the absence of the servants which amazes
me, for I understood that they had arrived.&nbsp; What would you
like to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you hungry, Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Simply starving.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So am I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, let us forage and see if we cannot find
something to eat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So hand in hand, and each with a candle in the other hand,
like a pair of young penitents, they continued their explorations
with more purpose than before.&nbsp; The kitchen, into which they
penetrated, had clearly been much used of late, for there were
dirty dishes scattered about, and the fire had been lighted,
though it was now out.&nbsp; In one corner was what seemed to be
a pile of drab-coloured curtains.&nbsp; In the other, an armchair
lay upon its side with legs projecting.&nbsp; A singular
disorder, very alien to Mrs. Watson&rsquo;s habits, pervaded the
apartment.&nbsp; A dresser with a cupboard over it claimed the
first attention of the hungry pair.&nbsp; With a cheer from Frank
and hand-clapping from Maude, they brought out a new loaf of
bread, some butter, some cheese, a tin of cocoa, and a bowl full
of eggs.&nbsp; Maude tied an apron over her pretty russet dress,
seized some sticks and paper, and had a fire crackling in a very
few minutes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put some water in the kettle, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here you are!&nbsp; Anything else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some in the small saucepan for the eggs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe they are &ldquo;cookers,&rdquo;&rsquo; said
he, sniffing at them suspiciously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold them up to the light, sir.&nbsp; There, they are
quite bright and nice.&nbsp; In with them!&nbsp; Now, if you will
cut some bread and butter it, we shall soon have our supper
ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s too new to cut,&rsquo; cried Frank, sawing
away upon the kitchen table.&nbsp; &lsquo;Besides, new bread is
better in chunks.&nbsp; Here are some cloths and knives and forks
in the dresser drawer.&nbsp; I will go and lay the
table.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And leave me here alone.&nbsp; No please, Frank, if I
am cook, you must be scullery-maid.&nbsp; Get the cups down and
put the cocoa in them.&nbsp; What fun it all is!&nbsp; I think it
is simply <i>splendid</i> to be mistress of a house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With one scullery-maid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she perfectly incompetent, and much given to
embracing her mistress.&nbsp; I must take my hat off.&nbsp; Get
the sugar for the cocoa out of the cupboard.&nbsp; The kettle is
singing, so it won&rsquo;t be long.&nbsp; Do you know,
Frank&rsquo;&mdash;she paused, listening, with the egg-saucepan
in her hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a dog or something in
the room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They had both become aware of a sort of sibilant breathing,
and they looked round them in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; asked Maude.&nbsp; &lsquo;Frank, I
believe it&rsquo;s a mouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hope for the best.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t frighten yourself
unnecessarily.&nbsp; I fancy it comes from under these
curtains.&rsquo;&nbsp; He approached them with his candle, and
was suddenly aware of a boot which was projecting from
them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Great Scot!&rsquo; he cried,
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s a woman here asleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reassured as to the mouse, Maude approached with her saucepan
still clutched in her hand.&nbsp; There could be no doubt either
as to the woman or the sleep.&nbsp; She lay in an untidy heap,
her head under the table, and her figure sprawling.&nbsp; She
appeared to be a very large woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; cried Frank, shaking her by the
shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hullo, you there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the woman slumbered peacefully on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heh, wake up, wake up!&rsquo; he shouted, and pulled
her up into a sitting position.&nbsp; But she slept as soundly
sitting as lying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The poor thing must be ill,&rsquo; said Maude.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O Frank, shall I run for a doctor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wake up, woman, wake up!&rsquo; Frank yelled, and
danced her up and down.&nbsp; She flopped about like a sawdust
doll, with her arms swinging in front of her.&nbsp; He panted
with his exertions, but she was serenely unconscious.&nbsp; At
last he had to lower her on to the floor again, putting a
footstool under her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no go,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can
make nothing of her.&nbsp; She will sleep it off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say, Frank, that she
is&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How horrible!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That kettle is boiling now.&nbsp; Suppose we have our
supper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Frank, I could not enjoy my supper with that
unfortunate woman lying there.&nbsp; O Frank, I know that you
could not either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless her!&rsquo; said Frank bitterly, as he gazed at
the inert lump.&nbsp; &lsquo;I really don&rsquo;t see why we
should put ourselves out for her.&nbsp; She is quite
comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh I couldn&rsquo;t, Frank.&nbsp; It would seem
inhuman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are we to do, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must put her to bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Great heavens!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear, it is our duty to put her to bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But look here, my dear girl, we must be
practical.&nbsp; The woman weighs half a ton, and the bedrooms
are at the top of the house.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s simply
impossible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Frank, that if you took her head
and I took her feet, we might get her up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not up the stair, dear.&nbsp; She is
enormous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, on to the drawing-room sofa,&rsquo; said
Maude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could have my supper, if I knew that she
was safe upon the sofa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Frank, seeing that there was no help for it, seized her
under the arms, and Maude took her ankles, and they bore her,
bulging but serene, down the passage.&nbsp; They staggered
exhausted into the drawing-room, and the new sofa groaned beneath
the weight.&nbsp; It was a curious and unsavoury inaugural
ceremony.&nbsp; Maude put a rug over the prostrate form, and they
returned to their boiling kettle and their uncooked eggs.&nbsp;
Then they laid the table, and served the supper, and enjoyed this
picnic meal of their own creating as no conventional meal could
ever have been enjoyed.&nbsp; Everything seemed beautiful to the
young wife&mdash;the wall-paper, the pictures, the carpet, the
rug; but to him, she was so beautiful in mind, and soul, and
body, that her presence turned the little room into an enchanted
chamber.&nbsp; They sat long together, and marvelled at their own
happiness&mdash;that pure serene happiness of mere companionship,
which is so much more intimate and deeper than all the transports
of passion.</p>
<p>But suddenly he sprang from his chair.&nbsp; There was the
sound of steps, of several steps, outside upon the gravel
path.&nbsp; Then a key clicked, and a burst of cold air told them
that the door was open.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s agin&rsquo; the law for me to enter,&rsquo;
said a gruff voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you she&rsquo;s very strong and violent,&rsquo;
said a second voice, which Frank recognised as that of Mrs.
Watson.&nbsp; &lsquo;She chased the maid out of the house, and I
can do nothing with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very sorry, mum, but it&rsquo;s clean agin&rsquo; the
law of England.&nbsp; Give me a warrant, and in I come.&nbsp; If
you will bring her to the doorstep, I will be answerable for her
removal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s in the dining-room.&nbsp; I can see the
lights,&rsquo; said Mrs. Watson; and then, &lsquo;Good Lord, Mr.
Crosse, what a fright you gave me!&nbsp; Oh dear me, that you
should have come when I was out, and I not expecting you for
another two days yet.&nbsp; Well, now, I shall never forgive
myself for this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But all the mistakes and misfortunes were very quickly
explained.&nbsp; The telegram was the root of the evil.&nbsp; And
then the new cook had proved to be a violent, intermittent
drunkard.&nbsp; She had chased the other maid out of the house,
and then, while Mrs. Watson rushed for the police, she had drunk
herself into the stupor in which she had been found.&nbsp; But
now, in the nick of time, the station cab came up with the
luggage, and so the still placidly slumbering culprit was carried
out to it, and sent off in the charge of the policeman.&nbsp;
Such was the first entry of Mr. and Mrs. Crosse into their home
at The Lindens.</p>
<h2><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>LAYING A COURSE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Frank Crosse</span> was a methodical young
man&mdash;his enemies might sometimes have called him
pedantic,&mdash;and he loved to reduce his life to rule and
order.&nbsp; It was one of his peculiarities.&nbsp; But how about
this new life into which he was entering?&nbsp; It took two to
draw up the rules for that.&nbsp; The little two-oared craft who
put out upon that voyage have to lay their own course, each for
itself; and all round them, as they go, they see the floating
timbers and broken keels of other little boats, which had once
started out full of hope and confidence.&nbsp; There are currents
and eddies, low sand-banks and sunken reefs, and happy the crews
who see them ahead, and trim their course to avoid them.&nbsp;
Frank brooded over it all.&nbsp; He had seen something of life,
for his years.&nbsp; He was observant and reflective.&nbsp; He
had watched his friends who were happy, and he had watched his
friends who were not.&nbsp; And now, as a result of all this wise
cogitation, he sat down at a table one evening, with a solemn
face, and a sheet of foolscap.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Maude,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I want to have a
serious talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude looked up in surprise from the linen which she was
marking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear!&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why &ldquo;oh dear&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s something wrong?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You looked so solemn, Frank.&nbsp; I thought you had
been looking at the tradesman&rsquo;s books.&nbsp; What is it,
dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Maude, I have been thinking of married life in
general.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think it would be a good thing if
we were to make some resolutions as to how it should be
conducted&mdash;some fundamental principles, as it
were?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh do, dear, do!&nbsp; What fun it will be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it&rsquo;s serious, Maude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear, I am quite serious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seemed to me, that if we could reduce it to certain
rules, then, whatever came upon us in the future, we should
always know exactly how to act.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are the rules, dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we can only arrive at them by talking it over
between ourselves.&nbsp; I could not draw up a set of rules, and
ask you to submit to them.&nbsp; That is not my idea of a
partnership.&nbsp; But if we found that we were agreed upon
certain points, then we could both adopt them by mutual
consent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How charming, Frank!&nbsp; Do please tell me some of
the points.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a few in my mind, and I should like to hear any
which you may have&mdash;any ideas, you know, how to get the very
highest and best out of our life.&nbsp; Now, first of all, there
is the subject of quarrelling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, how horrid!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear girl, we must look into the future.&nbsp; We are
going to live all our lives together.&nbsp; We must foresee and
prepare for all the chances of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But that is absurd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t live all your life and never be in a
bad temper!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But not with <i>you</i>, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I can be very aggravating sometimes.&nbsp; Now, my
idea is this.&nbsp; Ill-humour passes and hurts nobody.&nbsp; But
if two people are ill-humoured, then each excites the other, and
they say ever so much more than they mean.&nbsp; Let us make a
compact never both to be ill-humoured at the same time.&nbsp; If
<i>you</i> are cross, then it is your turn, and I stand
clear.&nbsp; If <i>I</i> am cross, you let me work it off.&nbsp;
When either hoists the danger-signal, the other is on
guard.&nbsp; What do you think of that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you are the funniest old boy&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you agree?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear, of course I agree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Article number one,&rsquo; said Frank, and scribbled
upon his paper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your turn, now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, dear, I have not thought of anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, here is another point.&nbsp; Never take
each other for granted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean by that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never relax those attentions which one lover shows to
another.&nbsp; Some husbands seem to forget that their wives are
ladies.&nbsp; Some wives speak to their husbands with less
courtesy and consideration than to any casual male visitor.&nbsp;
They mean no harm, but they get into a slack way.&nbsp; We must
not do that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think we are likely to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;People get into it unconsciously.&nbsp; Pull me up
sharply at the first sign.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next point that I have noted is an extension of the
last.&nbsp; Let each strive to be worthy of the love of the
other.&nbsp; People get slovenly and slipshoddy, as if it
didn&rsquo;t matter now that they were married.&nbsp; If each
were very keen to please the other, that would not be so.&nbsp;
How many women neglect their music after marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My goodness, I haven&rsquo;t practised for a
week!&rsquo; cried Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And their dress and their
hair&rsquo;&mdash;Maude&rsquo;s hand flew up to her curls.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My darling, yours is just perfect.&nbsp; But you know how
often a woman grows careless.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will love me
anyhow,&rdquo; she says to herself, and perhaps she is right, but
still it is not as it should be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Frank, I had no idea you knew so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have heard my friends&rsquo; experiences.&mdash;And
the man too: he should consider his wife&rsquo;s feelings as much
as he did his sweetheart&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If she dislikes smoke, he
should not smoke.&nbsp; He should not yawn in her presence.&nbsp;
He should keep himself well-groomed and attractive.&nbsp; Look at
that dirty cuff!&nbsp; I have no business to have it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if it could make any difference to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There now!&nbsp; That is what is so demoralising.&nbsp;
You should stand out for the highest.&nbsp; When I came to you at
St. Albans, I had not dirty cuffs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You forgive me the music, Frank, and I&rsquo;ll forgive
you the cuff.&nbsp; But I agree to all you say.&nbsp; I think it
is so wise and good.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ve got something to
add.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good.&nbsp; What is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Each should take an interest in the other&rsquo;s
department.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, of course they should.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is not done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why naturally, dear, you take an interest in my City
work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, but do you take as keen an interest in my
housekeeping?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I have been a little thoughtless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, dear, you haven&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You are always
full of consideration.&nbsp; But I have noticed it with mother,
and with others also.&nbsp; The husband pulls out his cheque-book
at the end of the week or month, and he says, &ldquo;Well, this
is rather more than we can afford,&rdquo; or &ldquo;This is less
than I expected,&rdquo; but he never really takes any interest in
his wife&rsquo;s efforts to keep things nice on a little.&nbsp;
He does not see it with her eyes and try to realise her
difficulties.&nbsp; Oh, I wish I could express myself better, but
I know that the interest is one-sided.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think what you say is quite right.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
try to remember that.&nbsp; How shall we enter it upon our
list?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That Interests should be mutual.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite right.&nbsp; I have it down.&nbsp; Well, any more
points?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is your turn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, there is this, and I feel that it is just the
holiest thing in matrimony, and its greatest
justification&mdash;that love should never degenerate into
softness, that each should consciously stimulate the better part
of the other and discourage the worse, that there should be a
discipline in our life, and that we should brace each other up to
a higher ideal.&nbsp; The love that says, &ldquo;I know it is
wrong, but I love him or her so much that I can&rsquo;t
refuse,&rdquo; is a poor sort of love for the permanent use of
married life.&nbsp; The self-respect which refuses to let the
most lofty ideal of love down by an inch is a far nobler thing,
and it wears better too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How will you express all that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mutual respect is necessary for mutual love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am sure that that is right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It sounds obvious, but the very intensity of love makes
love soft and blind.&nbsp; Now I have another, which I am
convinced that you will not agree with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me hear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have put it in this way, &ldquo;The tight cord is the
easiest to snap.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I mean that married couples should give each
other a certain latitude and freedom.&nbsp; If they don&rsquo;t,
one or other will sooner or later chafe at the restriction.&nbsp;
It is only human nature, which is an older and more venerable
thing than marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like that at all, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feared you wouldn&rsquo;t, dear, but I believe
you&rsquo;ll see it with me when I explain what I mean.&nbsp; If
you don&rsquo;t, then I must try to see it with you.&nbsp; When
one talks of freedom in married life, it means, as a rule,
freedom only for the man.&nbsp; He does what he likes, but still
claims to be a strict critic of his wife.&nbsp; That, I am sure,
is wrong.&nbsp; To take an obvious example of what I mean, has a
husband a right to read his wife&rsquo;s letters?&nbsp; Certainly
not, any more than she has a right to read his without his
permission.&nbsp; To read them as a matter of course would be
stretching the chain too tight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chain is a horrid word, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it is only a metaphor.&nbsp; Or take the subject
of friendships.&nbsp; Is a married man to be debarred from all
friendship and intimacy with another woman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude looked doubtful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to see the woman first,&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or is a married woman to form no friendship with
another man who might interest or improve her?&nbsp; There is
such a want of mutual confidence in such a view.&nbsp; People who
are sure of each other should give each other every freedom in
that.&nbsp; If they don&rsquo;t, they are again stretching it
tight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they do, it may become so slack that it might as
well not be there at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I felt sure that we should have an argument over
this.&nbsp; But I have seen examples.&nbsp; Look at the
Wardrops.&nbsp; <i>There</i> were a couple who were never
apart.&nbsp; It was their boast that everything was in common
with them.&nbsp; If he was not in, she opened his letters, and he
hers.&nbsp; And then there came a most almighty smash.&nbsp; The
tight cord had snapped.&nbsp; Now, I believe that for some
people, it is a most excellent thing that they should take their
holidays at different times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I do.&nbsp; No, not for us, by Jove!&nbsp; I am
generalising now.&nbsp; But for some couples, I am sure that it
is right.&nbsp; They reconsider each other from a distance, and
they like each other the better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but these rules are for our guidance, not for that
of other people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite right, dear.&nbsp; I was off the rails.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As you were,&rdquo; as your brother Jack would say.&nbsp;
But I am afraid that I am not going to convince you over this
point.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude looked charmingly mutinous.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Frank, you are not.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think
marriage can be too close.&nbsp; I believe that every hope, and
thought, and aspiration should be in common.&nbsp; I could never
get as near to your heart and soul as I should wish to do.&nbsp;
I want every year to draw me closer and closer, until we really
are as nearly the same person as it is possible to be upon
earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When you have to surrender, it is well to do so
gracefully.&nbsp; Frank stooped down and kissed his wife&rsquo;s
hand, and apologised.&nbsp; &lsquo;The wisdom of the heart is
greater than the wisdom of the brain,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; But
the love of man comes from the brain, far more than the love of
woman, and so it is that there will always be some points upon
which they will never quite see alike.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then we scratch out that item.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, dear.&nbsp; &lsquo;Put &ldquo;The cord which is
held tight is the easiest to snap.&rdquo;&nbsp; That will be all
right.&nbsp; The cord of which I speak is never held at
all.&nbsp; The moment it is necessary to hold it, it is of no
value.&nbsp; It must be voluntary, natural,
unavoidable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Frank amended his aphorism.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything more, dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I have thought of one other,&rsquo; said
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is that if ever you had to find fault with
me about anything, it should be when we are alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the same in your case with me.&nbsp; That is
excellent.&nbsp; What can be more vulgar and degrading than a
public difference of opinion?&nbsp; People do it half in fun
sometimes, but it is wrong all the same.&nbsp; Duly entered upon
the minutes.&nbsp; Anything else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only material things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but they count also.&nbsp; Now, in the matter of
money, I feel that every husband should allow his wife a yearly
sum of her own, to be paid over to her, and kept by her, so that
she may make her own arrangements for herself.&nbsp; It is
degrading to a woman to have to apply to her husband every time
she wants a sovereign.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the wife has
any money, she should have the spending of it.&nbsp; If she
chooses to spend part of it in helping the establishment, that is
all right, but I am sure that she should have her own separate
account, and her own control of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If a woman really loves a man, Frank, how can she
grudge him everything she has?&nbsp; If my little income would
take one worry from your mind, what a joy it would be to me to
feel that you were using it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but the man has his self-respect to think
of.&nbsp; In a great crisis one might fall back upon one&rsquo;s
wife&mdash;since our interests are the same, but only that could
justify it.&nbsp; So much for the wife&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; Now
for the question of housekeeping.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That terrible question!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only hard because people try to do so much upon a
little.&nbsp; Why should they try to do so much?&nbsp; The best
pleasures of life are absolutely inexpensive.&nbsp; Books, music,
pleasant intimate evenings, the walk among the heather, the
delightful routine of domestic life, my cricket and my
golf&mdash;these things cost very little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you must eat and drink, Frank.&nbsp; And as to
Jemima and the cook, it is really extraordinary the amount which
they consume.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the tendency is for meals to become much too
elaborate.&nbsp; Why that second vegetable?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There now!&nbsp; I knew that you were going to say
something against that poor vegetable.&nbsp; It costs so
little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On an average, I have no doubt that it costs threepence
a day.&nbsp; Come now, confess that it does.&nbsp; Do you know
what threepence a day comes to in a year?&nbsp; There is no use
in having an accountant for a husband, if you can&rsquo;t get at
figures easily.&nbsp; It is four pounds eleven shillings and
threepence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It does not seem very much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But for that money, and less, one could become a member
of the London Library, with the right to take out fifteen books
at a time, and all the world&rsquo;s literature to draw
from.&nbsp; Now just picture it: on one side, all the books in
the world, all the words of the wise, and great, and witty; on
the other side, a lot of cauliflowers and vegetable-marrows and
French beans.&nbsp; Which is the better bargain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good gracious, we shall never have a second vegetable
again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And pudding?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, you always eat the pudding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know I do.&nbsp; It seems an obvious thing to do when
the pudding is there in front of me.&nbsp; But if it were not
there, I should neither eat it nor miss it, and I know that you
care nothing about it.&nbsp; There would be another five or six
pounds a year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll have a compromise, dear.&nbsp; Second
vegetable one day, pudding the next.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I notice that it is always after you have had a
substantial meal that you discuss economy in food.&nbsp; I wonder
if you will feel the same when you come back starving from the
City to-morrow?&nbsp; Now, sir, any other economy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think money causes happiness.&nbsp; But
debt causes unhappiness.&nbsp; And so we must cut down every
expense until we have a reserve fund to meet any unexpected
call.&nbsp; If you see any way in which I could save, or any
money I spend which you think is unjustifiable, I do wish that
you would tell me.&nbsp; I got into careless ways in my bachelor
days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That red golfing-coat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know.&nbsp; It was idiotic of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, dear.&nbsp; You look very nice in it.&nbsp;
After all, it was only thirty shillings.&nbsp; Can you show me
any extravagance of mine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, dear, I looked at that dressmaker&rsquo;s bill
yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, it is such a pretty dress, and you said you
liked it, and you have to pay for a good cut, and you said
yourself that a wife must not become dowdy after marriage, and it
would have cost double as much in Regent Street.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think the dress dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was it, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The silk lining of the skirt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You funny boy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cost thirty shillings extra.&nbsp; Now, what can it
matter if it is lined with silk or not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Just you try one and
see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But no one can know that it is lined with
silk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I rustle into a room, dear, every woman in it
knows that my skirt is lined with silk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank felt that he had ventured out of his depth, so he struck
out for land again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s only one economy which I don&rsquo;t
think is justifiable,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and that is, to cut
down your subscriptions to charities.&nbsp; It is such a very
cheap way of doing things.&nbsp; Not that I do much in that
line&mdash;too little, perhaps.&nbsp; But to say that because
<i>we</i> want to economise, therefore some poor people are to
suffer, is a very poor argument.&nbsp; We must save at our own
expense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So now Frank, in his methodical fashion, had all his results
tabulated upon his sheet of foolscap.&nbsp; It was not a very
brilliant production, but it might serve as a chart for the
little two-oared boats until a better one is forthcoming.&nbsp;
It ran in this way&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>Maxims for the
Married</i></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Since you are married, you may as well make the best
of it.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; So make some maxims and try to live up to them.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t be discouraged if you fail.&nbsp; You
will fail, but perhaps you won&rsquo;t always fail.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Never both be cross at the same time.&nbsp; Wait your
turn.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Never cease to be lovers.&nbsp; If you cease, some
one else may begin.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; You were gentleman and lady before you were husband
and wife.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget it.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Keep yourself at your best.&nbsp; It is a compliment
to your partner.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Keep your ideal high.&nbsp; You may miss it, but it
is better to miss a high one than to hit a low one.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; A blind love is a foolish love.&nbsp; Encourage the
best in each other&rsquo;s nature.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Permanent mutual respect is necessary for a
permanent mutual love.&nbsp; A woman can love without respect,
but a man cannot.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; The tight cord is the easiest to snap.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Let there be one law for both.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; There is only one thing worse than quarrels in
public.&nbsp; That is caresses.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; Money is not essential to happiness, but happy
people usually have enough.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; So save some.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; The easiest way of saving is to do without
things.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t, then you had better do without a
wife.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; The man who respects his wife does not turn her into
a mendicant.&nbsp; Give her a purse of her own.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; If you save, save at your own expense.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; In all matters of money, prepare always for the
worst and hope for the best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was their course as far as this ambitious young couple
could lay it.&nbsp; They may correct it by experience, and
improve it by use, but it is good enough to guide them safely out
to sea.</p>

128</span>CONFESSIONS</h2>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Tell</span> me, Frank, did you ever
love any one before me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How badly trimmed the lamp is to-night!&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; It was so bad that he went off instantly into the
dining-room to get another.&nbsp; It was some time before he
returned.</p>
<p>She waited inexorably until he had settled down again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you, Frank?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ever love any one else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Maude, what <i>is</i> the use of asking
questions like that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You said that there were no secrets between
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, but there are some things better left
alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is what I should call a secret.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, if you make a point of it&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I am ready to answer anything that you
ask.&nbsp; But you must not blame me if you do not like my
answers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who was she, Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, more than one!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you that you would not like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I wish I had not asked you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then do let us drop it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t drop it now, Frank.&nbsp; You have
gone too far.&nbsp; You must tell me everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everything?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, everything, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not sure that I can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it so dreadful as that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, there is another reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do tell me, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a good deal of it.&nbsp; You know how a modern
poet excused himself to his wife for all his pre-matrimonial
experiences.&nbsp; He said that he was looking for
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I do like that!&rsquo; she cried indignantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was looking for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem to have looked a good deal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I found you at last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had rather you had found me at first,
Frank.&rsquo;&nbsp; He said something about supper, but she was
not to be turned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many did you really love?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t joke about it, Frank.&nbsp; I really
want to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I choose to tell you a lie&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you won&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I could never feel the same
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, how many did you love?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t exaggerate what I say, Maude, or take it to
heart.&nbsp; You see it depends upon what you mean by love.&nbsp;
There are all sorts and degrees of love, some just the whim of a
moment, and others the passion of a lifetime; some are founded on
mere physical passion, and some on intellectual sympathy, and
some on spiritual affinity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which do you love me with?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All three.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfectly sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She came over and the cross-examination was interrupted.&nbsp;
But in a few minutes she had settled down to it again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, now&mdash;the first?&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t, Maude&mdash;don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, sir&mdash;her name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Maude, that is going a little too far.&nbsp;
Even to you, I should never mention another woman&rsquo;s
name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who was she, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t let us go into details.&nbsp; It is
perfectly <i>horrible</i>.&nbsp; Let me tell things in my own
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She made a little grimace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are wriggling, sir.&nbsp; But I won&rsquo;t be hard
upon you.&nbsp; Tell it your own way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, in a word, Maude, I was always in love with some
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her face clouded over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your love must be very cheap,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s almost a necessity of existence for a
healthy young man who has imagination and a warm heart.&nbsp; It
was all&mdash;or nearly all&mdash;quite superficial.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think all your love was superficial, if it can
come so easily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross, Maude.&nbsp; I had never seen you
at the time.&nbsp; I owed no duty to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You owed a duty to your own self-respect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, I knew we should have trouble over it.&nbsp;
What do you want to ask such questions for?&nbsp; I dare say I am
a fool to be so frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sat for a little with her face quite cold and set.&nbsp;
In his inmost heart Frank was glad that she should be jealous,
and he watched her out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said she at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Must I go on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I may as well hear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll only be cross.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve gone too far to stop.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m
not cross, Frank.&nbsp; Only pained a little.&nbsp; But I do
appreciate your frankness.&nbsp; I had no idea you were such
a&mdash;such a Mormon.&rsquo;&nbsp; She began to laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I used to take an interest in every woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Take an interest&rdquo; is good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was how it began.&nbsp; And then if circumstances
were favourable the interest deepened, until at last,
naturally&mdash;well, you can understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many did you take an interest in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, in pretty nearly all of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how many deepened?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twenty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;rather more than that, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thirty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite thirty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not more than forty, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude sat aghast at the depths of his depravity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me see: you are twenty-seven now, so you have loved
four women a year since you were seventeen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you reckon it that way,&rsquo; said Frank, &lsquo;I
am afraid that it must have been more than forty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s dreadful,&rsquo; said Maude, and began to
cry.</p>
<p>Frank knelt down in front of her and kissed her hands.&nbsp;
She had sweet little plump hands, very soft and velvety.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You make me feel such a brute,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Anyhow, I love you now with all my heart and mind and
soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forty-firstly and lastly,&rsquo; she sobbed, half
laughing and half crying.&nbsp; Then she pulled his hair to
reassure him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be angry with you,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Besides, it would be ungenerous to be angry when you tell
me things of your own free will.&nbsp; You are not forced to tell
me.&nbsp; It is very honourable of you.&nbsp; But I do wish you
had taken an interest in me first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it was not so fated.&nbsp; I suppose there are
some men who are quite good when they are bachelors.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t believe they are the best men.&nbsp; They are either
archangels upon earth&mdash;young Gladstones and Newmans&mdash;or
else they are cold, calculating, timid, un-virile creatures, who
will never do any good.&nbsp; The first class must be
splendid.&nbsp; I never met one except in memoirs.&nbsp; The
others I don&rsquo;t want to meet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Women are not interested in generalities.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were they nicer than me?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those forty women.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, dear, of course not.&nbsp; Why are you
laughing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it came into my head how funny it would be, if
the forty were all gathered into one room, and you were turned
loose in the middle of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Funny!&rsquo; Frank ejaculated.&nbsp; Women have such
extraordinary ideas of humour.&nbsp; Maude laughed until she was
quite tired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t strike you as comic?&rsquo; she cried
at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he answered coldly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course it wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said she, and went
off into another ripple of pretty contralto laughter.&nbsp; There
is a soft, deep, rich laugh, which some women have, that is the
sweetest sound in Nature.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you have quite finished,&rsquo; said he
huffily.&nbsp; Her jealousy was much more complimentary than her
ridicule.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right now.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be cross.&nbsp; If I
didn&rsquo;t laugh I should cry.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so sorry if I
have annoyed you.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had gone back to his chair, so
she paid him a flying visit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Satisfied?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not quite.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right.&nbsp; I forgive you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s funny too.&nbsp; Fancy <i>you</i>
forgiving <i>me</i> after all these confessions.&nbsp; But you
never loved one of them all as you love me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Swear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do swear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Morally, and what do you call it, and the
other?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not one of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And never will again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good boy for ever and ever?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For ever and ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the forty were horrid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, hang it, Maude, I can&rsquo;t say that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She pouted and hung her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do like them better, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How absurd you are, Maude!&nbsp; If I had liked one
better, I should have married her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes, I suppose you would.&nbsp; You must have
taken a deeper interest in me than in the others, since you
married me.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silly old girl!&nbsp; Of course I liked you best.&nbsp;
Let us drop the thing, and never talk about it any
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you their photographs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None of them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did you do with them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never had most of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the others?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I destroyed some when I married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was nice of you.&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t you
sorry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I thought it was only right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you fondest of dark women or fair?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; <i>I</i> was never
pernickety in <i>my</i> tastes.&nbsp; You know those lines I read
you from Henley: &ldquo;Handsome, ugly&mdash;all are
women.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a bachelor&rsquo;s
sentiment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But do you mean to say, sir&mdash;now, you are speaking
on your honour, that out of all these forty, there was not one
who was prettier than I am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do let us talk of something else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And not one as clever?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How absurd you are to-night, Maude!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, answer me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve answered you already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not hear you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, you did.&nbsp; I said that I had married you,
and that shows that I liked you best.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t compare
you quality for quality against every one in the world.&nbsp;
That would be absurd.&nbsp; What I say is that your combination
of qualities is the one which is most dear to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I see,&rsquo; said Maude dubiously.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How nice and frank you are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ve hurt you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, not in the least.&nbsp; I like you to be
frank.&nbsp; I should hate to think that there was anything you
did not dare to tell me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you, Maude&mdash;would you be equally frank with
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear, I will.&nbsp; I feel that I owe it to you
after your confidence in me.&nbsp; I have had my little
experiences too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you would rather that I said nothing about
them.&nbsp; What good can there be in raking up these old
stories?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I had rather you told me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t be hurt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no&mdash;certainly not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may take it from me, Frank, that if any married
woman ever tells her husband that until she saw him she never
felt any emotion at the sight of another man, it is simple
nonsense.&nbsp; There may be women of that sort about, but I
never met them.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I should like them, for
they must be dry, cold, unsympathetic, unemotional, unwomanly
creatures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maude, you have loved some one else!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t deny that I have been interested deeply
interested in several men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Several!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was before I had met you, dear.&nbsp; I owed you no
duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have loved several men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The feeling was for the most part quite
superficial.&nbsp; There are many different sorts and degrees of
love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God, Maude!&nbsp; How many men inspired this
feeling in you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The truth is, Frank, that a healthy young woman who has
imagination and a warm heart is attracted by every young
man.&nbsp; I know that you wish me to be frank and to return your
confidence.&nbsp; But there is a certain kind of young man with
whom I always felt my interest deepen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you did discriminate?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now you are getting bitter.&nbsp; I will say no
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have said too much.&nbsp; You must go on
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I was only going to say that dark men always had
a peculiar fascination for me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what it
is, but the feeling is quite overpowering.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that why you married a man with flaxen
hair?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t expect to find every quality in
my husband, could I?&nbsp; It would not be reasonable.&nbsp; I
assure you, dear, that taking your <i>tout ensemble</i>, I like
you far the best of all.&nbsp; You may not be the handsomest, and
you may not be the cleverest&mdash;one cannot expect one&rsquo;s
absolute ideal,&mdash;but I love you far, far the best of
any.&nbsp; I do hope I haven&rsquo;t hurt you by anything I have
said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry I am not your ideal, Maude.&nbsp; It would
be absurd to suppose myself anybody&rsquo;s ideal, but I hoped
always that the eyes of love transfigured an object and made it
seem all right.&nbsp; My hair is past praying for, but if you can
point out anything that I can mend&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, I want you just as you are.&nbsp; If I
hadn&rsquo;t liked you best, I shouldn&rsquo;t have married you,
Frank, should I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But those other experiences?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, we had better drop them.&nbsp; What good can it
possibly do to discuss my old experiences?&nbsp; It will only
annoy you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; I honour you for your frankness in
speaking out, although I acknowledge that it is a little
unexpected.&nbsp; Go on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I forget where I was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had just remarked that before your marriage you had
love-affairs with a number of men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How horrid it sounds, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it did strike me in that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But that&rsquo;s because you exaggerate what I
said.&nbsp; I said that I had been attracted by several
men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that dark men thrilled you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had hoped that I was the first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was not fated to be so.&nbsp; I could easily tell
you a lie, Frank, and say that you were, but I should never
forgive myself if I were to do such a thing.&nbsp; You see I left
school at seventeen, and I was twenty-three when I became engaged
to you.&nbsp; There are six years.&nbsp; Imagine all the dances,
picnics, parties, visitings of six years.&nbsp; I could not help
meeting young men continually.&nbsp; A good many were interested
in me, and I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were interested in them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was natural, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, perfectly natural.&nbsp; And then I understand
that the interest deepened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sometimes.&nbsp; When you met a young man who was
interested several times running, at a dance, then in the street,
then in the garden, then a walk home at night&mdash;of course
your interest began to deepen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what was the next stage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sure you&rsquo;re not angry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, not at all.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you keep the
key in the spirit-stand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It might tempt Jemima.&nbsp; Shall I get it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, go on!&nbsp; The next stage was?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, when you have been deeply interested some time,
then you begin to have experiences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t shout, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I shout?&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; Go on!&nbsp; You
had experiences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why go into details?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must go on.&nbsp; You have said too much to
stop.&nbsp; I insist upon hearing the experiences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not if you ask for them in that way,
Frank.&rsquo;&nbsp; Maude had a fine dignity of her own when she
liked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t insist.&nbsp; I beg you to have
confidence in me, and tell me some of your
experiences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She leaned back in her armchair with her eyes half closed, and
a quiet retrospective smile upon her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you would really like to hear, Frank, as a
proof of my confidence and trust, I will tell you.&nbsp; You will
remember that I had not seen you at the time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will make every excuse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you a single experience.&nbsp; It was my
first of the sort, and stands out very clearly in my
memory.&nbsp; It all came through my being left alone with a
gentleman who was visiting my mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we were alone in the room, you
understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, go on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he paid me many little compliments: kept saying how
pretty I was, and that he had never seen a sweeter girl, and so
on.&nbsp; You know what gentlemen would say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I hardly answered him, but of course I was young
and inexperienced, and I could not help being flattered and
pleased at his words.&nbsp; I may have shown him what I felt, for
he suddenly&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kissed you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly.&nbsp; He kissed me.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t walk up
and down the room, dear.&nbsp; It fidgets me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right.&nbsp; Go on.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stop.&nbsp;
After this outrage what happened next?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You really want to know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must know.&nbsp; What did you do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so sorry that I ever began, for I can see that it
is exciting you.&nbsp; Light your pipe, dear, and let us talk of
something else.&nbsp; It will only make you cross if I tell you
the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t be cross.&nbsp; Go on.&nbsp; What did you
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Frank, since you insist&mdash;I kissed him
back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&mdash;you kissed him back!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have Jemima up if you go on like
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You kissed him back!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear; it may be wrong, but I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God! why did you do that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I liked him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A dark man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he was dark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Maude!&nbsp; Maude!&nbsp; Well, don&rsquo;t
stop.&nbsp; What then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he kissed me several times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course he would, if you kissed him.&nbsp; What else
could you expect?&nbsp; And then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on.&nbsp; I am ready for anything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, do sit down, and don&rsquo;t run about the
room.&nbsp; I am only agitating you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, I am sitting.&nbsp; You can see that I am not
agitated.&nbsp; For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, go on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He asked me if I would sit upon his knee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yek!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude began to laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Frank, you are croaking like a frog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad you think it a laughing matter.&nbsp; Go
on!&nbsp; Go on!&nbsp; You yielded to his very moderate and
natural request.&nbsp; You sat upon his knee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Frank, I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heavens!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be so excitable, dear.&nbsp; It was long
before I ever saw you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean to sit there and tell me in cold blood that
you sat upon this ruffian&rsquo;s knee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What else could I do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What could you do?&nbsp; You could have screamed, you
could have rung the bell, you could have struck him&mdash;you
could have risen in the dignity of your insulted womanhood and
walked out of the room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was not so easy for me to walk out of the
room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He held you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he held me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if I had been there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there was another reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t very good at walking at that
time.&nbsp; You see, I was only three years old.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank sat for a few minutes absorbing it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You little wretch!&rsquo; he said at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh you dear old goose!&nbsp; I feel so much
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You horror!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had to get level with you over my forty
predecessors.&nbsp; You old Bluebeard!&nbsp; But I did harrow you
a little&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harrow me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m raw all over.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a nightmare.&nbsp; O Maude, how could you have the
heart?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it was lovely&mdash;beautiful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was dreadful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how jealous you were!&nbsp; Oh, I <i>am</i> so
glad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rsquo; said Frank, as he put his
arms round her, &lsquo;that I ever quite realised
before&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And just then Jemima came in with the tray.</p>
<h2><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>CONCERNING MRS. BEETON</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Frank Crosse</span> had only been married
some months when he first had occasion to suspect that his wife
had some secret sorrow.&nbsp; There was a sadness and depression
about her at times, for which he was unable to account.&nbsp; One
Saturday afternoon he happened to come home earlier than he was
expected, and entering her bedroom suddenly, he found her seated
in the basket-chair in the window, with a large book upon her
knees.&nbsp; Her face, as she looked up at him with a mixed
expression of joy and of confusion, was stained by recent
tears.&nbsp; She put the book hastily down upon the
dressing-stand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maude, you&rsquo;ve been crying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Frank, no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Maude, you fibber!&nbsp; Remove those tears
instantly.&rsquo;&nbsp; He knelt down beside her and
helped.&nbsp; &lsquo;Better now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dearest, I am quite happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tears all gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, explain!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to tell you, Frank!&rsquo;&nbsp;
She gave the prettiest, most provocative little wriggles as her
secret was drawn from her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wanted to do it without
your knowing.&nbsp; I thought it would be a surprise for
you.&nbsp; But I begin to understand now that my ambition was
much too high.&nbsp; I am not clever enough for it.&nbsp; But it
is disappointing all the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank took the bulky book off the table.&nbsp; It was Mrs.
Beeton&rsquo;s <i>Book of Household Management</i>.&nbsp; The
open page was headed, &lsquo;General Observations on the Common
Hog,&rsquo; and underneath was a single large tear-drop.&nbsp; It
had fallen upon a woodcut of the Common Hog, in spite of which
Frank solemnly kissed it, and turned Maude&rsquo;s trouble into
laughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now you are all right again.&nbsp; I do hate to see you
crying, though you never look more pretty.&nbsp; But tell me,
dear, what was your ambition?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To know as much as any woman in England about
housekeeping.&nbsp; To know as much as Mrs. Beeton.&nbsp; I
wanted to master every page of it, from the first to the
last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are 1641 of them,&rsquo; said Frank, turning them
over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know.&nbsp; I felt that I should be quite old before
I had finished.&nbsp; But the last part, you see, is all about
wills, and bequests, and homeopathy, and things of that
kind.&nbsp; We could do it later.&nbsp; It is the early part that
I want to learn now&mdash;but it <i>is</i> so hard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why do you wish to do it, Maude?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I want you to be as happy as Mr.
Beeton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bet I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, you can&rsquo;t be, Frank.&nbsp; It says
somewhere here that the happiness and comfort of the husband
depend upon the housekeeping of the wife.&nbsp; Mrs. Beeton must
have been the finest housekeeper in the world.&nbsp; Therefore,
Mr. Beeton must have been the happiest and most comfortable
man.&nbsp; But why should Mr. Beeton be happier and more
comfortable than my Frank?&nbsp; From the hour I read that I
determined that he shouldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;and he won&rsquo;t
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he isn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you think so.&nbsp; But then you know nothing about
it.&nbsp; You think it right because I do it.&nbsp; But if you
were visiting Mrs. Beeton, you would soon see the
difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What an awkward trick you have of always sitting in a
window,&rsquo; said Frank, after an interval.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll swear that the wise Mrs. Beeton never advocates
that&mdash;with half a dozen other windows within point-blank
range.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, you shouldn&rsquo;t do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, you shouldn&rsquo;t be so nice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You really still think that I am nice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fishing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After all these months?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nicer and nicer every day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a bit tired?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You blessing!&nbsp; When I am tired of you, I shall be
tired of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How wonderful it all seems!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does it not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To think of that first day at the tennis-party.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hope you are not a very good player, Mr.
Crosse!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, Miss Selby, but I shall be happy
to make one in a set.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how we
began.&nbsp; And now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is wonderful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And at dinner afterwards.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you like
Irving&rsquo;s acting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I think that he
is a great genius.&rdquo;&nbsp; How formal and precise we
were!&nbsp; And now I sit curling your hair in a bedroom
window.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It <i>does</i> seem funny.&nbsp; But I suppose, if you
come to think of it, something of the same kind must have
happened to one or two people before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But never quite like us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, never quite like us.&nbsp; But with a kind of
family resemblance, you know.&nbsp; Married people do usually end
by knowing each other a little better than on the first day they
met.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What <i>did</i> you think of me, Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve told you often.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, tell me again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use when you know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I like to hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s just spoiling you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love to be spoiled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I thought to myself&mdash;If I can only
have that woman for my own, I believe I will do something in life
yet.&nbsp; And I also thought&mdash;If I don&rsquo;t get that
woman for my own, I will never, never be the same man
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, Frank, the very first day you saw
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, the very first day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then, day by day, and week by week, that feeling
grew deeper and stronger, until at last you swallowed up all my
other hopes, and ambitions, and interests.&nbsp; I hardly dare
think, Maude, what would have happened to me if you had refused
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laughed aloud with delight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How sweet it is to hear you say so!&nbsp; And the
wonderful thing is that you have never seemed disappointed.&nbsp;
I always expected that some day after marriage&mdash;not
immediately, perhaps, but at the end of a week or so&mdash;you
would suddenly give a start, like those poor people who are
hypnotised, and you would say, &ldquo;Why, I used to think that
she was pretty!&nbsp; I used to think that she was sweet!&nbsp;
How could I be so infatuated over a little, insignificant,
ignorant, selfish, uninteresting&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; O Frank, the
neighbours will see you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, you mustn&rsquo;t provoke me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What <i>will</i> Mrs. Potter think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should pull down the blinds before you make
speeches of that sort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now do sit quiet and be a good boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, tell me what you thought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you were a very good
tennis-player.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you talked nicely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I?&nbsp; I never felt such a stick in my
life.&nbsp; I was as nervous as a cat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was so delightful.&nbsp; I do hate people who are
very cool and assured.&nbsp; I saw that you were disturbed, and I
even thought&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I thought that perhaps it was I who disturbed
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you liked me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was very interested in you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that is the blessed miracle which I can never get
over.&nbsp; You, with your beauty, and your grace, and your rich
father, and every young man at your feet, and I, a fellow with
neither good looks, nor learning, nor prospects,
nor&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be quiet, sir!&nbsp; Yes, you shall!&nbsp;
Now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove, there <i>is</i> old Mrs. Potter at the
window!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve done it this time.&nbsp; Let us get
back to serious conversation again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did we leave it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was that hog, I believe.&nbsp; And then Mr.
Beeton.&nbsp; But where does the hog come in?&nbsp; Why should
you weep over him?&nbsp; And what are the Lady&rsquo;s
Observations on the Common Hog?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Read them for yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank read out aloud: &lsquo;&ldquo;The hog belongs to the
order Mammalia, the genus <i>sus scrofa</i>, and the species
<i>pachydermata</i>, or thick-skinned.&nbsp; Its generic
characters are a long, flexible snout, forty-two teeth, cloven
feet, furnished with four toes, and a tail, which is small,
short, and twisted, while, in some varieties, this appendage is
altogether wanting.&rdquo;&mdash;But what on earth has all this
to do with housekeeping?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> want to know.&nbsp; It is so
disheartening to have to remember such things.&nbsp; What does it
matter if the hog <i>has</i> forty-two toes.&nbsp; And yet, if
Mrs. Beeton knew it, one feels that one ought to know it
also.&nbsp; If once I began to skip, there would be no end to
it.&nbsp; But it really is such a splendid book in other
ways.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you want, you will find
it here.&nbsp; Take the index anywhere.&nbsp; Cream.&nbsp; If you
want cream, it&rsquo;s all there.&nbsp; Croup.&nbsp; If you
want&mdash;I mean, if you don&rsquo;t want croup, it will teach
you how not to get it.&nbsp; Crumpets&mdash;all about them.&nbsp;
Crullers&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t know what a cruller
is, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither do I.&nbsp; But I could look it up and
learn.&nbsp; Here it is&mdash;paragraph 2847.&nbsp; It is a sort
of pancake, you see.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how you learn
things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank Crosse took the book and dropped it.&nbsp; It fell with
a sulky thud upon the floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing that it can teach you, dear, can ever make up
to me if it makes you cry, and bothers you.&mdash;You bloated,
pedantic thing!&rsquo; he cried, in sudden fury, aiming a kick at
the squat volume.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is to you I owe all those sad,
tired looks which I have seen upon my wife&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; I
know my enemy now.&nbsp; You pompous, fussy old humbug,
I&rsquo;ll kick the red cover off you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Maude snatched it up, and gathered it to her bosom.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, no, Frank, I don&rsquo;t know what I should do without
it.&nbsp; You have no idea what a wise old book it is.&nbsp; Now,
sit there on the footstool at my feet, and I will read to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do, dear; it&rsquo;s delightful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sit quiet, then, and be good.&nbsp; Now listen to this
pearl of wisdom: &ldquo;As with the commander of an army, so it
is with the mistress of a house.&nbsp; Her spirit will be seen
through the whole establishment, and, just in proportion as she
performs her duties thoroughly, so will her domestics follow in
her path.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From which it follows,&rsquo; said her husband,
&lsquo;that Jemima must be a perfect paragon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the contrary, it explains all Jemima&rsquo;s
shortcomings.&nbsp; Listen to this: &ldquo;Early rising is one of
the most essential qualities.&nbsp; When a mistress is an early
riser, it is almost certain that her house will be orderly and
well managed.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you are down at nine&mdash;what more do you
want?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At nine!&nbsp; I am sure that Mrs. Beeton was always up
at six.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have my doubts about Mrs. B.&nbsp; Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.&nbsp; I should not be very much surprised
to learn that she had breakfast in bed every morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank!&nbsp; You have no reverence for
anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us have some more wisdom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Frugality and Economy are home virtues without
which no household can prosper.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson says,
&lsquo;Frugality may be termed&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, bother Dr. Johnson!&nbsp; Who cares for a
man&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp; Now, if it had been Mrs.
Johnson&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Johnson kept house for himself for years&mdash;and a
queer job he made of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I should think.&rsquo;&nbsp; Maude tossed her pretty
curls.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mrs. Beeton is all right, but I will not be
lectured by Dr. Johnson.&nbsp; Where was I?&nbsp; Oh
yes&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;We must always remember that to manage a
little well, is a great merit in housekeeping.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hurrah!&nbsp; Down with the second vegetable!&nbsp; No
pudding on fish days.&nbsp; <i>Vive la bi&egrave;re de
Pilsen</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a noisy boy you are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This book excites me.&nbsp; Anything more?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friendships should not be hastily formed, nor the heart
given at once to every newcomer&mdash;&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I should hope not!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let me catch
you at it!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mind my cigarette?&nbsp; Has
Mrs. Beeton a paragraph about smoking in bedrooms?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such an enormity never occurred to her as a remote
possibility.&nbsp; If she had known you, dear, she would have had
to write an appendix to her book to meet all the new problems
which you would suggest.&nbsp; Shall I go on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She next treats conversation.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
conversation, trifling occurrences such as small disappointments,
petty annoyances, and other everyday incidents, should never be
mentioned to friends.&nbsp; If the mistress be a wife, never let
a word in connection with her husband&rsquo;s failings pass her
lips&mdash;&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove, this book has more wisdom to the square inch
than any work of man,&rsquo; cried Frank, in enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought that would please you.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
temper should be cultivated by every mistress, as upon it the
welfare of the household may be said to turn.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excellent!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;In starting a household, it is always best in
the long-run to get the very best articles of their
kind.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is why I got you, Maude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir.&nbsp; We have a dissertation then upon
dress and fashion, another upon engaging domestics, another about
daily duties, another about visiting, another about fresh air and
exercise&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The most essential of any,&rsquo; cried Frank, jumping
up, and pulling his wife by the arms out of her low
wicker-chair.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is just time for nine holes at
golf before it is dark, if you wilt come exactly as you
are.&nbsp; But listen to this, young lady.&nbsp; If ever again I
see you fretting or troubling yourself about your household
affairs&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Frank, I won&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you do, Mrs. Beeton goes into the
kitchen-fire.&nbsp; Now remember?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are sure you don&rsquo;t envy Mr.
Beeton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t envy a man upon earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why should I try to be Mrs. Beeton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why indeed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, what a load off my mind!&nbsp; Those sixteen
hundred pages have just lain upon it for months.&nbsp; Dear old
boy! come on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And they clattered downstairs for their golf-clubs.</p>
<h2><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>MR.
SAMUEL PEPYS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were few things which Maude
liked so much as a long winter evening when Frank and she dined
together, and then sat beside the fire and made good cheer.&nbsp;
It would be an exaggeration to say that she preferred it to a
dance, but next to that supreme joy, and higher even than the
theatre in her scale of pleasures, were those serene and intimate
evenings when they talked at their will, and were silent at their
will, within their home brightened by those little jokes and
endearments and allusions which make up that inner domestic
masonry which is close-tiled for ever to the outsider.&nbsp; Five
or six evenings a week, she with her sewing and Frank with his
book, settled down to such enjoyment as men go to the ends of the
earth to seek, while it awaits them, if they will but atune their
souls to sympathy, beside their own hearthstones.&nbsp; Now and
again their sweet calm would be broken by a ring at the bell,
when some friend of Frank&rsquo;s would come round to pay them an
evening visit.&nbsp; At the sound Maude would say
&lsquo;bother,&rsquo; and Frank something shorter and stronger,
but, as the intruder appeared, they would both break into,
&lsquo;Well, really now it <i>was</i> good of you to drop in upon
us in this homely way.&rsquo;&nbsp; Without such hypocrisy, the
world would be a hard place to live in.</p>
<p>I may have mentioned somewhere that Frank had a catholic taste
in literature.&nbsp; Upon a shelf in their bedroom&mdash;a relic
of his bachelor days&mdash;there stood a small line of his
intimate books, the books which filled all the chinks of his life
when no new books were forthcoming.&nbsp; They were all volumes
which he had read in his youth, and many times since, until they
had become the very tie-beams of his mind.&nbsp; His tastes were
healthy and obvious without being fine.&nbsp; Macaulay&rsquo;s
<i>Essays</i>, Holmes&rsquo; <i>Autocrat</i>, Gibbons&rsquo;
<i>History</i>, Jefferies&rsquo; <i>Story of my Heart</i>,
Carlyle&rsquo;s Life, Pepys&rsquo; <i>Diary</i>, and
Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Lavengro</i> were among his inner circle of
literary friends.&nbsp; The sturdy East Anglian, half
prize-fighter, half missionary, was a particular favourite of
his, and so was the garrulous Secretary of the Navy.&nbsp; One
day it struck him that it would be a pleasant thing to induce his
wife to share his enthusiasms, and he suggested that the evenings
should be spent in reading selections from these old friends of
his.&nbsp; Maude was delighted.&nbsp; If he had proposed to read
the rig-vedas in the original Sanskrit, Maude would have listened
with a smiling face.&nbsp; It is in such trifles that a
woman&rsquo;s love is more than a man&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>That night Frank came downstairs with a thick well-thumbed
volume in his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is Mr. Pepys,&rsquo; said he solemnly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a funny name!&rsquo; cried Maude.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
makes me think of indigestion.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Oh yes, pepsine,
of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall take a dose of him every night after dinner to
complete the resemblance.&nbsp; But seriously, dear, I think that
now that we have taken up a course of reading, we should try to
approach it in a grave spirit, and endeavour to realise&mdash;Oh,
I say, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>am</i> so sorry, dear!&nbsp; I do hope I
didn&rsquo;t hurt, you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did&mdash;considerably.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It all came from my having the needle in my hand at the
time&mdash;and you looked so solemn&mdash;and&mdash;well, I
couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little wretch&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, dear; Jemima may come in any moment with the
coffee.&nbsp; Now, do sit down and read about Mr. Pepys to
me.&nbsp; And first of all, would you mind explaining all about
the gentleman, from the beginning, and taking nothing for
granted, just as if I had never heard of him before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, sir!&nbsp; Be a good boy and do exactly
what you are told.&nbsp; Now begin!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Maude, Mr. Pepys was born&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was his first name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Samuel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear, I&rsquo;m sure I should not have liked
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too late to change that.&nbsp; He was
born&mdash;I could see by looking, but it really doesn&rsquo;t
matter, does it?&nbsp; He was born somewhere in sixteen hundred
and something or other, and I forget what his father
was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must try to remember what you tell me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it all amounts to this, that he got on very well
in the world, that he became at last a high official of the navy
in the time of Charles the Second, and that he died in fairly
good circumstances, and left his library, which was a fine one,
to one of the universities, I can&rsquo;t remember
which.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is an accuracy about your information,
Frank&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know, dear, but it really does not matter.&nbsp; All
this has nothing to do with the main question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on, then!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, this library was left as a kind of dust-catcher,
as such libraries are, until one day, more than a hundred years
after the old boy&rsquo;s death, some enterprising person seems
to have examined his books, and he found a number of volumes of
writing which were all in cipher, so that no one could make head
or tail of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me, how very interesting!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it naturally excited curiosity.&nbsp; Why should a
man write volumes of cipher?&nbsp; Imagine the labour of
it!&nbsp; So some one set to work to solve the cipher.&nbsp; This
was about the year 1820.&nbsp; After three years they
succeeded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How in the world did they do it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, they say that human ingenuity never yet invented
a cipher which human ingenuity could not also solve.&nbsp;
Anyhow, they did succeed.&nbsp; And when they had done so, and
copied it all out clean, they found they had got hold of such a
book as was never heard of before in the whole history of
literature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude laid her sewing on her lap, and looked across with her
lips parted and her eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They found that it was an inner Diary of the life of
this man, with all his impressions, and all his doings, and all
his thoughts&mdash;not his ought-to-be thoughts, but his real,
real thoughts, just as he thought then at the back of his
soul.&nbsp; You see this man, and you know him very much better
than his own wife knew him.&nbsp; It is not only that he tells of
his daily doings, and gives us such an intimate picture of life
in those days, as could by no other means have been conveyed, but
it is as a piece of psychology that the thing is so
valuable.&nbsp; Remember the dignity of the man, a high
government official, an orator, a writer, a patron of learning,
and here you have the other side, the little thoughts, the mean
ideas which may lurk under a bewigged head, and behind a solemn
countenance.&nbsp; Not that he is worse than any of us.&nbsp; Not
a bit.&nbsp; But he is frank.&nbsp; And that is why the book is
really a consoling one, for every sinner who reads it can say to
himself, &ldquo;Well, if this man who did so well, and was so
esteemed, felt like this, it is no very great wonder that I
do.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude looked at the fat brown book with curiosity.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is it really all there?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, dear, it will never all be published.&nbsp; A good
deal of it is, I believe, quite impossible.&nbsp; And when he
came to the impossible places, he doubled and trebled his cipher,
so as to make sure that it should never be made out.&nbsp; But
all that is usually published is here.&rsquo;&nbsp; Frank turned
over the leaves, which were marked here and there with
pencilings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why are you smiling, Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only at his way of referring to his wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, he was married?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, to a very charming girl.&nbsp; She must have been
a sweet creature.&nbsp; He married her at fifteen on account of
her beauty.&nbsp; He had a keen eye for beauty had old
Pepys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were they happy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, fairly so.&nbsp; She was only twenty-nine when
she died!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor girl!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was happy in her life&mdash;though he <i>did</i>
blacken her eye once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not really?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he did.&nbsp; And kicked the housemaid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, the brute!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But on the whole he was a good husband.&nbsp; He had a
few very good points about him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how does he allude to his wife?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has a trick of saying, &ldquo;my wife, poor
wretch!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Impertinent!&nbsp; Frank, you said to-night that other
men think what this odious Mr. Pepys says.&nbsp; Yes, you
did!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t deny it!&nbsp; Does that mean that you
always think of me as &ldquo;poor wretch&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have come along a little since then.&nbsp; But how
these passages take you back to the homely life of those
days!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do read some.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, listen to this, &ldquo;And then to bed without
prayers, to-morrow being washing-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fancy such a
detail coming down to us through two centuries.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why no prayers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I suppose they had to get up
early on washing-days, and so they wanted to go to sleep
soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, dear, you do the same without as good
an excuse.&nbsp; Read another!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He goes to dine with some one&mdash;his uncle, I
think.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;An excellent dinner, but the venison
pasty was palpable beef, which was not
handsome.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How beautiful!&nbsp; Mrs. Hunt Mortimer&rsquo;s sole
last week was palpable plaice.&nbsp; Mr. Pepys is right.&nbsp; It
was not handsome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s another grand entry: &ldquo;Talked with my
wife of the poorness and meanness of all that the people about us
do, compared with what we do.&rdquo;&nbsp; I dare say he was
right, for they did things very well.&nbsp; When he dined out, he
says that his host gave him &ldquo;the meanest dinner of beef,
shoulder and umbles of venison, and a few pigeons, and all in the
meanest manner that ever I did see, to the basest
degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are umbles, dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no idea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, whatever they are, it sounds to me a very good
dinner.&nbsp; People must have lived very well in those
days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They habitually over-ate and over-drank
themselves.&nbsp; But Pepys gives us the menu of one of his own
entertainments.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve marked it somewhere.&nbsp; Yes,
here it is.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fricassee of rabbits and chickens, a leg
of mutton boiled, three carps in a dish, a great dish of a side
of lamb, a dish of roasted pigeons, a dish of four lobsters,
three tarts, a lamprey pie (a most rare pie!), a dish of
anchovies, good wine of several sorts, and all things mighty
noble and to my great content.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good gracious!&nbsp; I told you that I associated him
with indigestion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did them pretty well that time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who cooked all this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wife helped in those days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No wonder she died at twenty-nine.&nbsp; Poor
dear!&nbsp; What a splendid kitchen-range they must have
had!&nbsp; I never understood before why they had such enormous
grates in the old days.&nbsp; Naturally, if you have six pigeons,
and a lamprey, and a lobster, and a side of lamb, and a leg of
mutton, and all these other things cooking at the same time, you
would need a huge fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wonderful thing about Pepys,&rsquo; said Frank,
looking thoughtfully over the pages, &lsquo;is that he is capable
of noting down the mean little impulses of human nature, which
most men would be so ashamed of, that they would hasten to put
them out of their mind.&nbsp; His occasional shabbiness in money
matters, his jealousies, his envies, all his petty faults, which
are despicable on account of their pettiness.&nbsp; Fancy any man
writing this.&nbsp; He is describing how he visited a friend and
was reading a book from his library.&nbsp; &ldquo;A very good
book,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;especially one letter of advice to a
courtier, most true and good, which made me once resolve to tear
out the two leaves that it was writ in, but I forbore
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Imagine recording such a vile
thought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what you have never explained to me yet, dear, or
if you did, I didn&rsquo;t understand&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mind
my being a little stupid, do you?&mdash;is, what object Mr. Pepys
had in putting down all this in such a form that no one could
read it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you must bear in mind, dear, that he could read
it himself.&nbsp; Besides he was a fellow with a singularly
methodical side to his mind.&nbsp; He was, for example,
continually adding up how much money he had, or cataloguing and
indexing his library, and so on.&nbsp; He liked to have
everything shipshape.&nbsp; And so with his life, it pleased him
to have an exact record which he could turn to.&nbsp; And yet,
after all, I don&rsquo;t know that that is a sufficient
explanation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, indeed, it is not.&nbsp; My experience of
man&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Your</i> experience, indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, my experience of men&mdash;how rude you are,
Frank!&mdash;tells me that they have funny little tricks and
vanities which take the queerest shapes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&nbsp; Have I any?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&mdash;you are compounded of them.&nbsp; Not
vanity&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t mean that.&nbsp; But
pride&mdash;you are as proud as Lucifer, and much too proud to
show it.&nbsp; That is the most subtle form of pride.&nbsp; Oh
yes, I know perfectly well what I mean.&nbsp; But in this
man&rsquo;s case, it took the form of wishing to make a sensation
after his death.&nbsp; He could not publish such a thing when he
lived, could he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, he had to do it after his death.&nbsp; He
had to write it in cipher, or else some one would have found him
out during his lifetime.&nbsp; But, very likely, he left a key to
the cipher, so that every one might read it when he was gone, but
the key and his directions were in some way lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it is very probable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fire had died down, so Maude shipped off her chair, and
sat on the black fur rug, with her back against Frank&rsquo;s
knees.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, dear, read away!&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>But the lamp shone down upon her dainty head, and it gleamed
upon her white neck, and upon the fluffy, capricious, untidy,
adorable, little curlets, which broke out along the edges of the
gathered strands of her chestnut hair.&nbsp; And so, after the
fashion of men, his thoughts flew away from Mr. Pepys and the
seventeenth century, and all that is lofty and instructive, and
could fix upon nothing except those dear little wandering
tendrils, and the white column on which they twined.&nbsp; Alas,
that so small a thing can bring the human mind from its empyrean
flights!&nbsp; Alas, that vague emotions can drag down the
sovereign intellect!&nbsp; Alas, that even for an hour, a man
should prefer the material to the spiritual!</p>
<p>But the man who doesn&rsquo;t misses a good deal.</p>
<h2><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>A
VISIT TO MR. SAMUEL PEPYS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are several unjustifiable
extravagances which every normal man commits.&nbsp; There are
also several unjustifiable economies.&nbsp; Among others, there
is that absurd eagerness to save the striking of a second match,
which occasions so many burned fingers, and such picturesque
language.&nbsp; And again, there is the desire to compress a
telegraphic message into the minimum sixpennyworth, and so send
an ambiguous and cryptic sentence, when sevenpence would have
made it as clear as light.&nbsp; We all tend to be stylists in
our telegrams.</p>
<p>A week after the conversation about Mr. Pepys, when some
progress had been made with the reading of the <i>Diary</i>,
Maude received the following wire from Frank&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Mrs.
Crosse</span>.&nbsp; Woking.&mdash;Pepys buttered toast
su&egrave;de gloves four Monument wait late.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a sixpennyworth it was a success, but as a message it
seemed to leave something to be desired.&nbsp; Maude puzzled over
it, and tried every possible combination of the words.&nbsp; The
nearest approach to sense was when it was divided in this
way&mdash;Pepys&mdash;buttered toast&mdash;su&egrave;de
gloves&mdash;four&mdash;Monument, wait late.</p>
<p>She wrote it out in this form, and took it section by
section.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pepys,&rsquo; that was
unintelligible.&nbsp; &lsquo;Buttered toast,&rsquo; no sense in
that.&nbsp; &lsquo;Su&egrave;de gloves,&rsquo; yes, she had told
Frank that when she came to town, she would buy some su&egrave;de
gloves at a certain shop in the City, where she could get for
three and threepence a pair which would cost her three and
ninepence in Woking.&nbsp; Maude was so conscientiously
economical, that she was always prepared to spend two shillings
in railway fares to reach a spot where a sixpence was to be
saved, and to lavish her nerve and energy freely in the
venture.&nbsp; Here, then, in the su&egrave;de gloves, was a
central point of light.&nbsp; And then her heart bounded with
joy, as she realised that the last part could only mean that she
was to meet Frank at the Monument at four, and that she was to
wait for him if he were late.</p>
<p>So, now, returning to the opening of the message, with the
light which shone from the ending, she realised that buttered
toast might refer to a queer little City hostel, remarkable for
that luxury, where Frank had already taken her twice to
tea.&nbsp; And so leaving Mr. Pepys to explain himself later,
Maude gave hurried orders to Jemima and the cook, and dashed
upstairs to put on her new fawn-coloured walking-dress&mdash;a
garment which filled her with an extraordinary mixture of delight
and remorse, for it was very smart, cost seven guineas, and had
not yet been paid for.</p>
<p>The rendezvous was evidently a sudden thought upon the part of
Frank, for he had left very little time for her to reach the
trysting-place.&nbsp; However, she was fortunate in catching a
train to Waterloo, and another thence to the City, and so reached
the Monument at five minutes to four.&nbsp; The hour was just
striking when Frank, with his well-brushed top-hat and immaculate
business frock-coat, came rushing from the direction of King
William Street.&nbsp; Maude held out her hand and he shook it,
and then they both laughed at the formality.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so glad you were able to come, dearest.&nbsp; How
you do brighten up the old City!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do I?&nbsp; I felt quite lonely until you came.&nbsp;
Nothing but droves of men&mdash;and all staring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s your dress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, thank you, sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Entirely that pretty brown&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brown!&nbsp; Fawn colour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s brown.&nbsp; Anyhow, it looks
charming.&nbsp; And so do you&mdash;by Jove you do, Maude!&nbsp;
Come this way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are we going?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By underground.&nbsp; Here we are.&mdash;Two second
singles, Mark Lane, please!&mdash;No, that&rsquo;s for the
west-end trains.&nbsp; Down here!&nbsp; Next train, the man
says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were in the mephitic cellar, with the two long wooden
platforms where the subterranean trains land or load their
freights.&nbsp; A strangling gas tickled their throats and set
them coughing.&nbsp; It was all dank and dark and gloomy.&nbsp;
But little youth and love care for that!&nbsp; They were bubbling
over with the happiness of this abnormal meeting.&nbsp; Both
talked together in their delight, and Maude patted Frank&rsquo;s
sleeve with every remark.&nbsp; They could even illuminate all
that was around them, by the beauty and brightness of their own
love.&nbsp; It went the length of open praise for their
abominable surroundings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it grand and solemn?&rsquo; said
Maude.&nbsp; &lsquo;Look at the black shadows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When they come to excavate all this some thousands of
years hence, they will think it was constructed by a race of
giants,&rsquo; Frank answered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The modern works for the benefit of the community are
really far greater than those which sprang from the caprice of
kings.&nbsp; The London and North-Western Railway is an
infinitely grander thing than the pyramids.&nbsp; Look at the two
headlights in the dark!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Two sullen crimson discs glowed in the black arch of the
tunnel.&nbsp; With a menacing and sinister speed, they grew and
grew until roaring they sprang out of the darkness, and the long,
dingy train, with a whining of brakes, drew up at the
platform.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s one nearly empty,&rsquo; said Frank, with
his hand on the handle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;&rsquo; said Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I do,&rsquo; cried Frank.</p>
<p>And they got into one which was quite empty.&nbsp; For the
underground railway is blessed as regards privacy above all other
lines, and where could a loving couple be more happy, who have
been torn apart by cruel fate for seven long hours or so?&nbsp;
It was with a groan that Frank remarked that they had reached
Mark Lane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bother!&rsquo; said Maude, and wondered if there were
any shop near where she could buy hairpins.&nbsp; As every lady
knows, or will know, there is a very intimate connection between
hairpins and a loving husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Frank, about your telegram.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, dear.&nbsp; Come along where I lead you, and
you will understand all about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They passed out of Mark Lane Station and down a steep and
narrow street to the right.&nbsp; At the bottom lay an old
smoke-stained church with a square tower, and a small open
churchyard beside it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the church of Saint Olave,&rsquo; said
Frank.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are going into it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pushed open a folding oaken door, and they found themselves
inside it.&nbsp; Rows of modern seats filled the body of it, but
the walls and windows gave an impression of great
antiquity.&nbsp; The stained glass&mdash;especially that which
surmounted the altar&mdash;contained those rich satisfying
purples and deep deep crimsons which only go with age.&nbsp; It
was a bright and yet a mellow light, falling in patches of vivid
colour upon the brown woodwork and the grey floors.&nbsp; Here
and there upon the walls were marble inscriptions in the Latin
tongue, with pompous allegorical figures with trumpets, for our
ancestors blew them in stone as well as in epitaphs over their
tombs.&nbsp; They loved to die, as they had lived, with dignity
and with affectation.&nbsp; White statues glimmered in the
shadows of the corners.&nbsp; As Frank and his wife passed down
the side-aisle, their steps clanged through the empty and silent
church.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here he is!&rsquo; said Frank, and faced to the
wall.</p>
<p>He was looking up at the modern representation of a gentleman
in a full and curly wig.&nbsp; It was a well-rounded and comely
face, with shrewd eyes and a sensitive mouth.&nbsp; The face of a
man of affairs, and a good fellow, with just that saving touch of
sensuality about it which makes an expression human and
lovable.&nbsp; Underneath was printed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">SAMUEL PEPYS</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Erected by public subscription</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1883.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t he nice?&rsquo; said Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not a bad-looking chap, is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that man ever could have struck
his wife or kicked the maid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s calling him a liar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear, I forgot that he said so himself.&nbsp; Then I
suppose he must have done it.&nbsp; What a pity it
seems.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cheer up!&nbsp; We must say what the old heathen lady
said when they read the gospels to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did she say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She said, &ldquo;Well, it was a long time ago, and
we&rsquo;ll hope that it wasn&rsquo;t true!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, how can you tell such stories in a
church.&nbsp; Do you really suppose that Mr. Pepys is in that
wall?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I presume that the monument marks the grave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a little bit of plaster loose.&nbsp; Do
you think I might take it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t quite the thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it can&rsquo;t matter, and it isn&rsquo;t wrong,
and we are quite alone.&rsquo;&nbsp; She picked off the little
flake of plaster, and her heart sprang into her mouth as she did
so, for there came an indignant snort from her very elbow, and
there was a queer little smoke-dried, black-dressed person who
seemed to have risen, like the Eastern genii or a modern genius,
in a single instant.&nbsp; A pair of black list slippers
explained the silence of his approach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put that back, young lady,&rsquo; said he severely.</p>
<p>Poor Maude held out her guilty relic on the palm of her
hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am so sorry,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am afraid I cannot put it back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave the &rsquo;ole church picked to
pieces at this rate,&rsquo; said the clerk.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave done it, and it was very
wrong.&rsquo;&nbsp; He snorted and shook his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s of no consequence,&rsquo; said Frank.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The plaster was hanging, and must have fallen in any
case.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t make a fuss about a trifle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clerk looked at the young gentleman and saw defiance in
one of his eyes and half a crown in the other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; he grumbled.&nbsp; &lsquo;It shows
as the young lady takes an interest, and that&rsquo;s more than
most.&nbsp; Why, sir, if you&rsquo;ll believe me, there&rsquo;s
not one in a hundred that comes to this church that ever
&rsquo;eard of Pepys.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pepys!&rdquo; says they.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Oo&rsquo;s Pepys?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Diarist,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Diarist!&rdquo; says they,
&ldquo;wot&rsquo;s a Diarist?&rdquo;&nbsp; I could sit down
sometimes an&rsquo; cry.&nbsp; But maybe, miss, you thought as
you were picking that plaster off &rsquo;is grave?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I thought so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clerk chuckled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t so.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you
where &rsquo;e really lies, if you&rsquo;ll promise you
won&rsquo;t pick another chunk off that.&nbsp; Well, then,
it&rsquo;s there&mdash;beside the communion.&nbsp; I saw
&rsquo;im lyin&rsquo; there with these very eyes, and &rsquo;is
wife in the coffin beneath &rsquo;im.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You saw him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, I saw &rsquo;im, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s more
than any livin&rsquo; man could say, for there were only four of
us, and the other three are as dead as Pepys by now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh do tell us about it!&rsquo; cried Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it was like this, miss.&nbsp; We &rsquo;ad to
examine to see &rsquo;ow much room there was down there, and so
we came upon them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what did you see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, miss, &rsquo;is coffin lay above, and &rsquo;is
wife&rsquo;s below, as might be expected, seeing that she died
thirty years or so before &rsquo;im.&nbsp; The coffins was very
much broken, an&rsquo; we could see &rsquo;im as clear us I can
see you.&nbsp; When we first looked in I saw &rsquo;im lying
quite plain&mdash;a short thick figure of a man&mdash;with
&rsquo;is &rsquo;ands across &rsquo;is chest.&nbsp; And then,
just as we looked at &rsquo;im, &rsquo;e crumbled in, as you
might say, across &rsquo;is breast bone, an&rsquo; just quietly
settled down into a &rsquo;uddle of dust.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a way
they &rsquo;as when the fresh air strikes &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; she the same, an&rsquo; &lsquo;is dust just fell
through the chinks o&rsquo; the wood and mixed itself with
&rsquo;ers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank!&rsquo;&nbsp; Maude&rsquo;s ready tears sprang
to her eyes.&nbsp; She put her hand upon her husband&rsquo;s and
was surprised to find how cold it was.&nbsp; Women never realise
that the male sex is the more sensitive.&nbsp; He had not said,
&lsquo;O Maude!&rsquo; because he could not.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They used some powder like pepper for embalmin&rsquo;
in those days,&rsquo; said the clerk.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the
vicar&mdash;it was in old Bellamy&rsquo;s time&mdash;&rsquo;e
took a sniff into the grave, an&rsquo; &rsquo;e sneezed an&rsquo;
sneezed till we thought we should &rsquo;ave to fetch a
doctor.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ave you seen Mrs. Pepys&rsquo;
tomb?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, we have only just come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it on the left of the common.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With the woman leaning forward?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Mrs. Pepys
herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was an arch laughing face, the face of a quite young woman;
the sculptor had depicted her as leaning forward in an animated
and natural attitude.&nbsp; Below was engraved&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Obiit</p>
<p style="text-align: center">X<sup>o</sup> Novembris</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&AElig;tatis 29</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Conjugii 15</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Anno Domini 1669.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Poor dear!&rsquo; whispered Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was hard that she should die just as her husband was
becoming famous and successful,&rsquo; said Frank.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She who had washed his shirts, and made up the coal fires,
when they lived in a garret together.&nbsp; What a pity that she
could not have a good time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah well, if she loved him, dear, she had a good time in
the garret.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude was leaning forward with her face raised to look at the
bust of the dead woman, which also leaned forward as if to look
down upon her.&nbsp; A pair of marble skulls flanked the
lady&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; A red glow from the evening sun struck
through a side-window and bathed the whole group in its ruddy
light.&nbsp; As Frank, standing back in the shadow, ran his eyes
from the face of the dead young wife to that of his own sweet,
girlish bride, with those sinister skulls between, there came
over him like a wave, a realisation of the horror which lies in
things, the grim close of the passing pageant, the black gloom,
which swallows up the never-ending stream of life.&nbsp; Will the
spirit wear better than the body; and if not, what infernal
practical joke is this to which we are subjected!</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will.&nbsp; It must,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Why</i>, Frank&mdash;Frank dear, what is the
matter?&nbsp; You are quite pale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come out into the air, Maude.&nbsp; I have had enough
of this stuffy old church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stuffy!&rsquo; said the clerk.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
we&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad the Lord Mayor &rsquo;ere at least once a
year, an&rsquo; &rsquo;e never found it stuffy.&nbsp; A cleaner,
fresher church you won&rsquo;t find in the city of London.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s &rsquo;ad its day, I&rsquo;ll allow.&nbsp; There was a
time&mdash;and I can remember it&mdash;when folk used to spend
their money where they made it, and the plate would be full of
paper and gold, where now we find it &rsquo;ard enough to get
coppers.&nbsp; That was fifty year ago, when I was a young
clerk.&nbsp; You might not think it, but I&rsquo;ve seen a Lord
Mayor, a past Lord Mayor, and a Lord Mayor elect of the city of
London, all sitting on one bench in this very church.&nbsp; And
<i>you</i> call it stuffy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank soothed the wounded feelings of the old clerk, and
explained that by stuffy he meant interesting.&nbsp; He also
shook hands with him in a peculiar way as he held his palm
upturned in the small of his back.&nbsp; Then Maude and he
retraced their steps up the narrow street which is called
Seething Lane.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor old boy!&nbsp; What was it, then?&rsquo; asked
Maude, looking up with her sympathetic eyes.&nbsp; It is at such
moments that a man realises what the companionship of women
means.&nbsp; The clouds melted before the sun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What an ass I was!&nbsp; I began to think of all sorts
of horrible things.&nbsp; Never mind, Maude!&nbsp; We are out for
a holiday.&nbsp; Hang the future!&nbsp; Let us live in the
present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always do,&rsquo; said Maude, and she spoke for her
sex.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what now?&nbsp; Buttered toast or su&egrave;de
gloves?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Business first!&rsquo; said Maude primly, and so
proceeded to save her sixpence on the gloves.&nbsp; As she was
tempted, however (&lsquo;such a civil obliging shopman,
Frank!&rsquo;), to buy four yards of so-called Astrakhan
trimming, a frill of torchon lace, six dear little festooned
handkerchiefs, and four pairs of open-work stockings&mdash;none
of which were contemplated when she entered the shop&mdash;her
sixpenny saving was not as brilliant a piece of finance as she
imagined.</p>
<p>And then they finished their excursion in the dark,
wainscotted, low-ceilinged coffee-room of an old-fashioned inn,
once the mother of many coaches, and now barren and deserted, but
with a strange cunning in the matter of buttered toast which had
come down from more prosperous days.&nbsp; It was a new waiter
who served them, and he imagined them to be lovers and scented an
intrigue; but when they called for a second plate of toast and a
jug of boiling water, he recognised the healthy appetite of the
married.&nbsp; And then, instead of going home like a good little
couple, Maude suddenly got it into her head that it would cheer
away the last traces of Frank&rsquo;s gloom if they went to see
&lsquo;Charley&rsquo;s Aunt&rsquo; at the Globe.&nbsp; So they
loitered and shopped for a couple of hours, and then squeezed
into the back of the pit; and wedged in among honest, hearty folk
who were not ashamed to show their emotions, they laughed until
they were tired.&nbsp; And so home, as their friend Pepys would
have said, after such a day as comes into the memory, shining
golden among the drab, when old folk look back, and think of the
dear dead past.&nbsp; May you and I, reader, if ever we also come
to sit in our final armchairs in the chimney corners, have many
such to which our minds may turn, sweet and innocent and
fragrant, to cheer us in those darksome hours to come.</p>
<h2><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>TROUBLE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening Frank came home with a
clouded face.&nbsp; His wife said nothing, but after dinner she
sat on a footstool beside his chair and waited.&nbsp; She knew
that if it were for the best, he would tell her everything, and
she had confidence enough in his judgment to acquiesce in his
silence if he thought it best to be silent.&nbsp; As a matter of
fact, it was just this telling her which made his trouble hard to
bear.&nbsp; And yet he thought it wiser to tell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had something to worry me, dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor old boy, I know you have.&nbsp; What was
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should I bother you with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A nice wife I should be, if I shared all your joys and
none of your sorrows!&nbsp; Anyhow, I had rather share sorrow
with you than joy within any one else.&rsquo;&nbsp; She snuggled
her head up against his knee.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell me about it,
Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You remember my telling you just before our marriage
that I was surety for a man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remember perfectly well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His name was Farintosh.&nbsp; He was an
insurance-agent, and I became surety for him in order to save his
situation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear, it was so noble of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Maude, he was on the platform this morning, and
when he saw me, he turned on his heel and hurried out of the
station.&nbsp; I read guilt in his eyes.&nbsp; I am sure that his
accounts are wrong again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, what an ungrateful wretch!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor devil, I dare say he has had a bad time.&nbsp; But
I was a fool not to draw out of that.&nbsp; It was all very well
when I was a bachelor.&nbsp; But here I am as a married man faced
with an indefinite liability and nothing to meet it with.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what is to become of us, Maude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much is it, dearest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; That is the worst of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But surely your own office would not be so hard upon
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not my own office.&nbsp; It is another
office&mdash;the Hotspur.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear!&nbsp; What have you done about it,
Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I called at their office in my lunch-hour, and I
requested them to send down an accountant to examine
Farintosh&rsquo;s books.&nbsp; He will be here to-morrow morning,
and I have leave of absence for the day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so they were to spend an evening and a night without
knowing whether they were merely crippled or absolutely
ruined.&nbsp; Frank&rsquo;s nature was really a very proud one,
and the thought of failing in his engagements wounded his
self-respect most deeply.&nbsp; His nerves winced and quivered
before it.&nbsp; But her sweet, strong soul rose high above all
fear, and bore him up with her, into the serenity of love and
trust and confidence.&nbsp; The really precious things, the
things of the spirit, were permanent, and could not be
lost.&nbsp; What matter if they lived in an eight-roomed villa,
or in a tent out on the heath?&nbsp; What matter if they had two
servants, or if she worked for him herself?&nbsp; All this was
the merest trifle, the outside of life.&nbsp; But the intimate
things, their love, their trust, their pleasures of mind and
soul, these could not be taken away from them while they had life
to enjoy them.&nbsp; And so she soothed Frank with sweet caresses
and gentle words, until this night of gloom had turned to the
most beautiful of all his life, and he had learned to bless the
misfortune which had taught him to know the serene courage and
the wholehearted devotion which can only be felt, like the scent
of a fragrant leaf, when Fate gives us a crush between its iron
fingers.</p>
<p>Shortly after breakfast Mr. Wingfield, the accountant from
London, arrived&mdash;a tall, gentlemanly man, with a formal
manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about this business, Mr. Crosse,&rsquo;
said he.</p>
<p>Frank made a grimace.&nbsp; &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be
helped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will hope that the amount is not very serious.&nbsp;
We have warned Mr. Farintosh that his books will be inspected
to-day.&nbsp; When you are ready we shall go round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The agent lived in a side-street not far off.&nbsp; A brass
plate, outside a small brick house, marked it out from the line
of other small brick houses.&nbsp; A sad-faced woman opened the
door, and Farintosh himself, haggard and white, was seated among
his ledgers in the little front room.&nbsp; A glance at the
man&rsquo;s helpless face turned all Frank&rsquo;s resentment to
pity.</p>
<p>They sat down at the table, the accountant in the centre,
Farintosh on the right, and Frank on the left.&nbsp; There was no
talk save an occasional abrupt question and answer.&nbsp; For two
hours the swish and rustle of the great blue pages of the ledgers
were the chief sound, with the scratching of Mr.
Wingfield&rsquo;s pen as he totalled up long columns of
figures.&nbsp; Frank&rsquo;s heart turned to water as he saw the
huge sums which had passed through this man&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp;
How much had remained there?&nbsp; His whole future depended upon
the answer to that question.&nbsp; How prosaic and undramatic are
the moments in which a modern career is made or marred!&nbsp; In
this obscure battlefield, the squire no longer receives his
accolade in public for his work well done, nor do we see the
butcher&rsquo;s cleaver as it hacks off the knightly spurs, but
failure and success come strangely and stealthily, determined by
trifles, and devoid of dignity.&nbsp; Here was the crisis of
Frank&rsquo;s young life, in this mean front room, amongst the
almanacs and the account-books.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can I rely upon these figures?&rsquo; asked Wingfield
at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that case I congratulate you, Mr. Crosse.&nbsp; I
can only find a deficiency of fifty pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Only enough to swallow the whole of their little savings,
which they had carefully invested!&nbsp; However, it was good
news, and Frank shook the proffered hand of the accountant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will stay for another hour to check these
figures,&rsquo; said Wingfield.&nbsp; &lsquo;But there is no need
to detain you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will come round and lunch with us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Au revoir</i>, then.&rsquo;&nbsp; Frank ran all the
way home, and burst in upon his wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not so
very bad, dear&mdash;only fifty pounds.&rsquo;&nbsp; They danced
about in their joy like two children.</p>
<p>But Wingfield came to his lunch within a solemn face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry to disappoint you,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;but the matter is more serious than I thought.&nbsp; We
have entered some sums as unpaid which he has really received,
but the receipts for which he has held back.&nbsp; They amount to
another hundred pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude felt inclined to cry as she glanced at Frank, and saw
his resolute effort to look unconcerned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s a hundred and fifty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not less.&nbsp; I have marked the items down
upon this paper for your inspection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank glanced his practised eyes over the results of the
accountant&rsquo;s morning&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have credited him within a hundred and twenty
pounds in the bank, I see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, his bank-book shows a balance of that
amount.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When was it made out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Last Saturday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He may have drawn it since them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is certainly possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We might go round after lunch and make sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And in any case, as it is the Company&rsquo;s money,
don&rsquo;t you think we had better take it out of his
hands?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I think you are right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a miserable meal, and they were all glad when it was
finished.&nbsp; Maude drew Frank into the other room before he
started.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not let you go without <i>that</i>,
dearest.&nbsp; Keep a brave heart, my own laddie, for I know so
well that we shall come through it all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Frank set out with a higher courage, and they both returned
to the agent&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; His white face turned a shade
whiter when he understood their errand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this necessary, Mr. Wingfield?&rsquo; he
pleaded.&nbsp; &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you take my word for this
money?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to have to say it, sir, but we have trusted
in your word too often.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the money is there, I swear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the Company&rsquo;s money, and we must have
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will ruin my credit locally if I draw out my whole
account under compulsion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then let him keep ten pounds in,&rsquo; said
Frank.&nbsp; Farintosh agreed with an ill grace to the
compromise, and they all started off for the bank.&nbsp; When
they reached the door the agent turned upon them with an
appealing face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t come in with me, gentlemen.&nbsp; I could
never hold up my head again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is for Mr. Crosse to decide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be unreasonable, Farintosh.&nbsp;
Go in alone and draw the money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They could never understand why he begged for that extra five
minutes.&nbsp; Perhaps it was that he had some mad hope of
persuading the bank manager to allow him to overdraw to that
amount.&nbsp; If so, the refusal was a curt one, for he
reappeared with a ghastly face and walked up to Frank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may as well confess to you, Mr. Crosse, I have
nothing in the bank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank whistled and turned upon his heel.&nbsp; He could not by
reproaches add to the wretched man&rsquo;s humiliation.&nbsp;
After all, he had himself to blame.&nbsp; He had incurred a risk
with his eyes open, and he was not the man to whine now that the
thing had gone against him.&nbsp; Wingfield walked home with him
and murmured some words of sympathy.&nbsp; At the gate the
accountant left him and went on to the station.</p>
<p>So their liability had risen from fifty to two hundred and
seventy pounds.&nbsp; Even Maude was for an instant daunted by
the sum.&nbsp; The sale of their furniture would hardly meet
it.&nbsp; It was the blackest hour of their lives, and yet,
always a strange sweet undercurrent of joy was running through
it, for it is only sorrow, fairly shared and bravely borne, which
can weld two human souls together.</p>
<p>Dinner was over when there came a ring at the bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please, sir, Mr. Farintosh would like to see
you,&rsquo; said the maid Jemima.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Show him in here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Frank, that I had better
go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I never asked him to
come.&nbsp; If he comes, let him face us both.&nbsp; I have not
made much of my dealings with him alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was shown in, downcast, shifty-eyed, and ill at ease.&nbsp;
He laid his hat upon the floor, and crept humbly towards the
chair which Frank pushed towards him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Farintosh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mr. Crosse, I have come round to tell you, and
you too, missus, the sorrow I feel that I have brought this
trouble upon you.&nbsp; I hoped all would have gone right after
that last time, but I&rsquo;ve had to pay up back debts, and
that&rsquo;s what has put me wrong.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never had
what one may call a fair chance.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m really
sorry, sir, that you who have, as one might say, befriended me,
should have to suffer for it in this way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Words won&rsquo;t mend it, Farintosh.&nbsp; I only
blame you for not coming to me when first things began to go
wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, I was always hoping that I could turn them
right again, so as you wouldn&rsquo;t need to be troubled at
all.&nbsp; And so it went from bad to worse until we find
ourselves here.&nbsp; But what I wanted to ask you, Mr. Crosse,
was what you meant to do about it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank writhed before this home question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I suppose I am responsible,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean to pay the money, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, somebody must pay it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you remember the wording of the bond, Mr.
Crosse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not the exact wording.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, I should advise you to get your lawyer to
read it.&nbsp; In my opinion, sir, you are not liable at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not liable!&rsquo;&nbsp; Frank felt as if his heart had
turned suddenly from a round-shot to an air-balloon.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why not liable?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were a little slapdashy, if one might say so, in
matters of business, sir, and perhaps you read that bond less
carefully than I did.&nbsp; There was a clause in it by which the
Company agreed frequently and periodically to audit my accounts,
so as to prevent your liability being at any time a very high
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So there was!&rsquo; cried Frank.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
didn&rsquo;t they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir, they didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove&mdash;Maude, do you hear that?&mdash;if that is
right, they brought their own misfortunes upon themselves.&nbsp;
Do you mean to say they never audited you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, they did so four times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In how long?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In fourteen months.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The air-balloon was gone and the cannon-ball back in its place
once more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will be held to exonerate them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir, I think not.&nbsp; &ldquo;Frequently and
periodically&rdquo; does not mean four times in fourteen
months.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A jury might take it so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Consider, sir, that the object was that your liability
should be limited.&nbsp; Thousands of pounds were passing through
my hands in that time, and therefore these four audits were, as
one might say, insufficient for the object of the
bond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I think,&rsquo; cried Maude, with conviction.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Frank, we&rsquo;ll have the best advice upon the subject
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And meanwhile, Mr. Crosse,&rsquo; said Farintosh,
rising from his chair, &lsquo;I am your witness, whether the
Company prosecutes me or not.&nbsp; And I hope that this will be
some humble atonement for the trouble that I have brought
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so a first rift of light began to shine in the dark
place.&nbsp; But it was not broadened by the letter which he
found waiting upon his breakfast-table&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>Re</i>
Farintosh&rsquo;s Accounts.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Hotspur
Insurance Office</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;On arriving in
London I came here at once, and checked Farintosh&rsquo;s
accounts from the books of the head office.&nbsp; I am sorry to
say that I find a further discrepancy of seventy pounds.&nbsp; I
am able, however, to assure you that we have now touched
bottom.&nbsp; The total amount is three hundred and forty pounds,
and a cheque for that sum at your early convenience would oblige
us, as we are anxious to bring so unpleasant a business to a
conclusion.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">James
Wingfield</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which Frank and Maude in collaboration&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I note
your claim for &pound;340 on account of the affairs of your agent
Farintosh.&nbsp; I am advised, however, that there have been
certain irregularities in the matter, about which I must make
some investigation before paying the claim.&mdash;Yours
truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Frank
Crosse</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which the Hotspur Insurance Office&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Had your
letter been a plea for more time to fulfil your engagement, we
should have been content to wait; but since you appear disposed
to dispute your liability, we have no alternative but to take
immediate steps to enforce payment.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">John
Waters</span>, <i>Secretary</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which Frank and Maude&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;My
solicitor, A. C. R. Owen, of 14 Shirley Lane, E.C., will be happy
to accept service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is the correct legal English for &lsquo;You may go to
the devil!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But this is an anticipation.&nbsp; In the meantime, having
received the original letter and answered it, Frank went up to
town as usual, while Maude played the more difficult part of
waiting quietly at home.&nbsp; In his lunch-hour Frank went to
see his friend and solicitor, who in turn obtained leave to see
the bond, and came back with a grave face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have a case,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but by no means
a certainty.&nbsp; It all depends upon how the judge might read
the document.&nbsp; I think that it would strengthen our case
very materially if we had counsel&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll copy the bond and show it to Manners, and have his
opinion before you go back to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Frank went round again after office-hours, and found Owen
waiting in very low spirits, for their relations were closer than
those of mere solicitor and client.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very sorry,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Opinion against us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dead against us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank tried to look as if he didn&rsquo;t mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me see it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a long blue document with the heading, &lsquo;The
Hotspur Insurance Company, Limited, <i>v.</i> Frank
Crosse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have perused the case submitted to me, and the papers
accompanying the same,&rsquo; said the learned counsel,
&lsquo;and in my opinion the Hotspur Insurance Company, Limited,
are entitled to recover from Mr. Crosse under his guarantee, the
sum of &pound;340, being monies received by Mr. Farintosh, and
not paid over by him to the said Company.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was
a great deal more, but it was anticlimax.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what shall we do?&rsquo; asked Frank
helplessly.&nbsp; The British law makes one feel so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I should stand out, if I were you.&nbsp; There is
certainly a chance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, old chap,&rsquo; said Frank, &lsquo;I may as
well be honest with you.&nbsp; If this thing goes against me, I
am stony broke.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know where your costs are
coming from.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about that,&rsquo; said Owen
kindly.&nbsp; &lsquo;After all, Manners is not infallible.&nbsp;
Let us have Holland, and see what he can make of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So twenty-four hours later Frank found Owen radiant with
another opinion in his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dead for us this time.&nbsp; Look here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he read out, &lsquo;I have carefully considered the case
submitted to me for my opinion, and the documents sent
therewith.&nbsp; In my opinion the Hotspur Insurance Company,
Limited, are not entitled to recover against Mr. Crosse the sum
claimed by them or any part thereof, as there has been a breach
on their part of an essential condition of the
guarantee.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He reads &ldquo;frequently and
periodically&rdquo; as we do,&rsquo; continued Owen, glancing
over the long document, &lsquo;and he is very clear as to our
case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose we have another, and try the best of
three,&rsquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s too expensive a game.&nbsp; No, Holland is a
sound man, and his opinion would weigh with any judge.&nbsp; I
think we have enough to go on with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you think it is safe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, nothing is ever safe in the law.&nbsp; But we
can make a fight of it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now Frank was to learn what it meant to be entangled in an
intricate clumsy old machine, incredibly cumbrous and at the same
time incredibly powerful, jolting along with its absurd forms and
abominable English towards an end which might or might not be
just, but was most certainly ruinously expensive.&nbsp; The game
began by a direct letter from the Queen, of all people, an honour
which Frank had never aspired to before, and certainly never did
again.</p>
<p>Victoria, by the grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith, remarked
abruptly to Frank Crosse of Woking, in the county of Surrey,
&lsquo;We command you that within eight days of the service of
this writ on you, inclusive of the day of such service, you cause
an appearance to be entered for you in an action at the suit of
the Hotspur Insurance Company, Limited.&rsquo;&nbsp; If he
didn&rsquo;t do so, Her Majesty remarked that several very
unpleasant things might occur, and Hardinge Stanley, Earl of
Halsbury, corroborated Her Majesty.&nbsp; Maude was frightened to
death when she saw the document, and felt as if unawares they
must have butted up against the British Constitution, but Owen
explained that it was only a little legal firework, which meant
that there might be some trouble later.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, at any rate,&rsquo; said Frank, &lsquo;it means
that in eight days it will all be over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Owen laughed heartily at the remark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It means,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that in eight days we
must promise that at some future date we will begin to make
preparations for something to happen in the future.&nbsp; That is
about the meaning of it.&nbsp; All you can do now is to be
perfectly philosophic, and leave the rest to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But how is a man with a capital of fifty pounds going to be
philosophic when he is fighting an opponent whose assets, as a
certain hoarding near Clapham Junction told him every morning,
exceeded three millions of pounds.&nbsp; He treated it lightly to
Maude, and she to him, but each suffered horribly, and each was
well aware of the other&rsquo;s real feelings.&nbsp; Sometimes
there was a lull, and they could almost believe that the whole
thing was over.&nbsp; And then the old machine gave a creak, and
the rusty cog-wheels took one more turn, and they both felt the
horrid thing which held them.</p>
<p>First of all, they had to enter appearances, which meant that
they would dispute the action.&nbsp; Then the other side had to
make an affidavit verifying their claim.&nbsp; Then a Master had
to pronounce whether the action should be treated offhand, or
whether he would listen to what they had to say about it.&nbsp;
He decided to listen to what was to be said.&nbsp; Then each side
claimed to see the other&rsquo;s documents,
&lsquo;discovery&rsquo; they called it, as if the documents were
concealed, and they had to hunt for them stealthily with
lanterns.&nbsp; Then each made remarks about the other&rsquo;s
documents, and claimed to see the remarks so made.&nbsp; Then the
lawyers of the Company made a statement of their claim, and when
she read it Maude burst into tears, and said that it was all
over, and they must make the best of it, and she should never
forgive herself for that new dress in the spring.&nbsp; And then
Frank&rsquo;s lawyer drew up a defence, and when Frank heard it,
he said, &lsquo;Why, what a silly business it seems!&nbsp; They
have not got a leg to stand upon.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so, after all
these flourishes and prancings, the two parties did actually
begin to show signs of coming to a hearing after all, and a day
was fixed for the trial.&nbsp; By a coincidence it was
Frank&rsquo;s birthday.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a good
omen!&rsquo; cried Maude.</p>
<p>The first herald of the approaching conflict was a seedy
person, who thrust a paper into Frank&rsquo;s hand as he emerged
from The Lindens in the morning.&nbsp; It was another letter from
Her Majesty, in which sub p&oelig;n&acirc; (Her Majesty has not a
gracious way of putting things in these documents), Mr. Frank
Crosse had &lsquo;to attend at the Royal Courts of Justice,
Strand, at the sittings of the Queen&rsquo;s Bench Division of
our High Court of Justice, to give evidence on behalf of the
Hotspur Company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to Frank to be a most unexpected and fearsome
stroke, but Owen simply laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is mere bluff,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
makes me think that they are weakening.&nbsp; They want to
frighten you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They did,&rsquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two can play at that game.&nbsp; We must keep a bold
front.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To subp&oelig;na all their crowd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Capital!&rsquo; cried Frank.&nbsp; So a clerk was sent
across to the Hotspur office with a whole bundle of
subp&oelig;nas, and served them liberally out.&nbsp; And in two
days&rsquo; time was the day of battle.</p>
<h2><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>A
RESCUE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the day fixed for the hearing
drew near, Ruin lived with them by day and slept with them by
night.&nbsp; Its dark shadow covered their lives, and they moved
in the gloom of its presence.&nbsp; If the trial went against
them, and Owen in his most hopeful moods did not disguise from
them that it might, they would have to pay the double costs as
well as the original claim.&nbsp; All that they possessed would
not cover it.&nbsp; On the other hand, if they won, this rich
Company might carry the matter to a higher Appeal Court, and so
involve them in a fresh succession of anxieties and
expenses.&nbsp; Do what they would, there was always
danger.&nbsp; Frank said little, and he slept little also.</p>
<p>One night, just before the trial, Wingfield, the accountant of
the Society, came down to Woking.&nbsp; He had managed the case
all through for the directors.&nbsp; His visit was a sort of
ultimatum.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are still ready to pay our own law-costs,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;if you will allow the original claim.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; said Frank doggedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The costs are piling up at a furious rate, and some one
will have to pay them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope that it will be you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t say afterwards that I did not warn
you.&nbsp; My dear Crosse, I assure you that you are being
misled, and that you have not really got a leg to stand
upon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what the trial is about,&rsquo; said
Frank.</p>
<p>He kept a bold face to the enemy, but after Wingfield&rsquo;s
departure, Maude saw that his confidence was greatly shaken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He seemed very sure of their case,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;He would not speak like that if he did not
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Maude took quite another view.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they know that they can recover their money in
court, why should they send Mr. Wingfield down in this
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is such a good chap&mdash;he wants to save us
expense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude was less trusting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is doing the best for his own side,&rsquo; said
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is his duty, and we can&rsquo;t blame
him.&nbsp; But if he thought it best to get behind his own
lawyers and come down here, then he must have some doubts about
going into court.&nbsp; Perhaps he would be willing to consider
some compromise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Frank only shook his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have drawn the cork, and we must drink the
wine,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have gone too far to
stop.&nbsp; Any compromise which they would accept would be as
much out of our power to pay as the whole sum would be, and so we
may just as well see it through.&rsquo;&nbsp; But for once Maude
did not take his opinion as final, but lay awake all night and
thought it over.&nbsp; She had determined to begin acting upon
her own account, and she was so eager to try what she could do
that she lay longing for the morning to break.&nbsp; When she
came down to breakfast, her plan of campaign was formed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am coming up to town with you, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Delighted to hear it, dear.&rsquo;&nbsp; When she had
shopping to do, she frequently went up with him, so it did not
surprise him.&nbsp; What would have surprised him was to know
that she had despatched three telegrams, by means of Jemima,
before he was up.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;To John Selby, 53 Fenchurch Street,
E.C.&nbsp; Will call eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Important
business.&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Maude</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Lieutenant Selby, the Dep&ocirc;t, Canterbury.&nbsp;
Please come up next train, meet me Fenchurch Street, eleven
thirty.&nbsp; Important.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Maude</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Owen, 14 Shirley Lane, E.C.&nbsp; Will call twelve
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Important.&mdash;<span class="smcap">mrs.
Crosse</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So she had opened her campaign.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the way, Frank,&rsquo; said she, as they travelled
up together, &lsquo;to-morrow is your birthday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear, it is,&rsquo; he answered lugubriously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me!&nbsp; What shall I give my boy for a birthday
present?&nbsp; Nothing you particularly want?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have all I want,&rsquo; said he, looking at her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but I think I could find something.&nbsp; I must
look round when I am in town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She began her looking round by a visit to her father in
Fenchurch Street.&nbsp; It was something new for him to get
telegrams from Maude upon business, and he was very much
surprised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Looking remarkably well, my dear.&nbsp; Your appearance
is a certificate of character to your husband.&nbsp; Well, and
how is all at Woking?&nbsp; I hope the second cook proved to be a
success.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Maude was not there for small talk.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear
dad,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I want you to stand by me, for I am
in trouble.&nbsp; Now, my dear good dad, please see things from
my point of view, and don&rsquo;t make objections, and do exactly
what I ask you.&rsquo;&nbsp; She threw her arms round his neck
and gave him a hearty squeeze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I call that exerting undue pressure,&rsquo; said
he, extricating his white head.&nbsp; &lsquo;If this sort of
thing is allowed in the city of London, there is an end of all
business.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, his eyes twinkled and looked as
if he liked it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now madame, what can I do for
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to be perfectly business-like,&rsquo;
said she, and gave him another squeeze before sitting down.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Look here, dad.&nbsp; You give me an income of fifty
pounds a year, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear girl, I can&rsquo;t raise it.&nbsp;
Jack&rsquo;s expenses in the Hussars&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to raise it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I seem to remember, dad, that you told me that this
fifty pounds was the interest on a thousand pounds which was
invested for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it is&mdash;five per cent. debentures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, dad, if I were content with an income of
twenty-five pounds a year instead of fifty pounds, then I could
take five hundred pounds out of my money, and nobody would be the
worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Except yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude laughed at that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want the use of the money just for one day.&nbsp; I
certainly won&rsquo;t need it all.&nbsp; I just want to feel that
I have as much as that in case I need it.&nbsp; Now, my dear old
daddy, do please not ask any questions, but be very nice and
good, and tell me how I can get these five hundred
pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you won&rsquo;t tell me why you want
them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had rather not&mdash;but I will if you
insist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Old Selby looked into the brave, clear eyes of his daughter,
and he did not insist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got your own little
banking account, have you not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; Never mix it up with your
husband&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&nbsp; He scribbled a cheque.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pay that in!&nbsp; It is for five hundred pounds.&nbsp; I
will sell half your debentures and charge you with
brokerage.&nbsp; I believe in strict business between
relatives.&nbsp; When you pay back the five hundred pounds, your
allowance will be fifty a year once more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude then and there endorsed the cheque and posted it to her
bank.&nbsp; Then with a final embrace to her father, she hastened
out to further victories.&nbsp; Jack Selby was smoking a
cigarette upon the doorstep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hullo, Maude!&nbsp; Calling up the reserves?&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; Jolly lucky it wasn&rsquo;t my day
on duty.&nbsp; You girls think a soldier has nothing to do.&nbsp;
It was so once, but we are all scientific blokes now.&nbsp; No,
thank you, I won&rsquo;t see the dad!&nbsp; He&rsquo;d think I
had come for money, and it would upset him for the
day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude took her brother in the cab with her, and told him the
whole story of Frank&rsquo;s misfortune, with some account of her
own intentions.&nbsp; Jack was vastly interested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did dad say about it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell him.&nbsp; I thought Frank would
rather not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite right.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t mind me.&nbsp; He
knows I&rsquo;m a bit of a business man myself.&nbsp; Only signed
a paper once in my life, and quite a small paper too, and I
haven&rsquo;t heard the last of it yet.&nbsp; The thing
wasn&rsquo;t much bigger than a postcard, but the fuss those
people made afterwards!&nbsp; I suppose they&rsquo;ve been
worrying Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have had no peace for months.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Worry is bad for the young.&nbsp; But he should not
mind.&nbsp; He should go on fizzing like I did.&nbsp; Now
we&rsquo;ll put this thing through together, Maude.&nbsp; I see
your line, and I&rsquo;ll ride it with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They found Mr. Owen at home, and Maude did the talking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am convinced, Mr. Owen, that they don&rsquo;t want to
go into court.&nbsp; Mr. Wingfield coming down like that proves
it.&nbsp; My husband is too proud to bargain with them, but I
have no scruples.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think that I might go to
Mr. Wingfield myself, and pay the three hundred and forty pounds,
and so have done with the worry for ever?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speaking as a lawyer,&rsquo; said Owen, &lsquo;I think
that it is very irregular.&nbsp; Speaking as a man, I think no
harm could come of it.&nbsp; But I should not like you to offer
the whole sum.&nbsp; Simply say that you are prepared for a
reasonable compromise, and ask them to suggest what is the lowest
sum which the office would accept to close the
business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You leave it with me,&rsquo; said Jack, winking at the
lawyer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am seeing her through.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
keep her on the rails.&nbsp; I am Number 1, Class A, at
business.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em up one link in the
curb if they try any games with us!&nbsp; Come on, Maude, and get
it over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was an excellent companion for her, for his buoyancy turned
the whole thing into fun.&nbsp; She could not take it too
seriously in his company.&nbsp; They called at the Hotspur office
and asked to see Mr. Wingfield.&nbsp; He was engaged, but Mr.
Waters, the secretary, a very fat, pompous man, came in to
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;very sorry,
indeed, Mrs. Crosse, but it is too late for any compromise of the
sort.&nbsp; We have our costs to consider, and there is no
alternative but for the case to go into court.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Maude nearly burst into tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But suppose that we were to offer&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To give you an hour to think it over,&rsquo; cried
Jack.</p>
<p>Mr. Waters shook, his head despondently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think that we should alter our decision.&nbsp;
However, Mr. Wingfield will be here presently, and he will, of
course, listen to any representations which you may have to
make.&nbsp; In the meantime you must excuse me, as I have matters
of importance to attend to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Maude, you little Juggins,&rsquo; cried Jack, when
the door was shut, &lsquo;you were just going to offer to pay
their costs.&nbsp; I only just headed you off in time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I was going to inquire about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Great Scot, it&rsquo;s lucky you&rsquo;ve got a
business man at your elbow.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t stand that
chap at any price.&nbsp; A bit too hairy in the fetlocks for my
taste.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t you see that he was only
bluffing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you know, Jack?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was shining all over him.&nbsp; Do you suppose a man
has bought as many hairies as I have, and can&rsquo;t tell when a
dealer is bluffing?&nbsp; He was piling it on so that when the
next Christmas-tree comes along, he may find a soft job waiting
for him.&nbsp; I tell you you want a friendly native, like me,
when you get into this kind of country.&nbsp; Now ride this one
on the curb, and don&rsquo;t let him have his head for a
moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wingfield had entered, and his manner was very different
to that of the secretary.&nbsp; He had great sympathy with the
Crosses, and no desire to wash the Company&rsquo;s dirty linen in
public.&nbsp; He was, therefore, more anxious than he dared to
show to come to some arrangement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is rather irregular for me to see you.&nbsp; I
should refer you to our solicitors,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we saw you when you came to Woking,&rsquo; said
Maude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe that we are much more likely to
come to an arrangement if we talk it over ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure I earnestly hope so,&rsquo; Wingfield
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall be delighted to listen to anything
which you may suggest.&nbsp; Do you, in the first place, admit
your liability?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To some extent,&rsquo; said Maude, &lsquo;if the
Company will admit that they are in the wrong also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we may go so far as to say that we wish the books
had been inspected more often, and that we regret our misplaced
confidence in our agent.&nbsp; That should satisfy you, Mrs.
Crosse.&nbsp; And now that you admit <i>some</i> liability, that
is a great step in advance.&nbsp; We have no desire to be
unreasonable, but as long as no liability was admitted, we had no
course open to us but litigation.&nbsp; We now come to the
crucial point, which is, how much liability should fall upon
you.&nbsp; My own idea is, that each should pay their own costs,
and that you should, in addition, pay over to the
Company&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forty pounds,&rsquo; said Jack firmly.</p>
<p>Maude expected Mr. Wingfield to rise up and leave the
room.&nbsp; As he did not do so, nor show any signs of violence,
she said, &lsquo;Yes, forty pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me, Mrs. Crosse, this is a very small
sum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forty pounds is our offer,&rsquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But on what is this offer based?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have worked it out,&rsquo; said Jack, &lsquo;and we
find that forty pounds is right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wingfield rose from his chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;of course any offer is
better than no offer.&nbsp; I cannot say what view the directors
may take of this proposal, but they will hold a board meeting
this afternoon, and I will lay it before them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when shall we know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could send you round a line by hand to your
solicitor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No hurry about it!&nbsp; Quite at your own
convenience!&rsquo; said Jack.&nbsp; When he got outside, in the
privacy of their hansom, he was convulsed with the sense of his
own achievements.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Class A, Number 1, and mentioned at the Agricultural
Hall,&rsquo; he cried, hugging himself in his delight.&nbsp; His
sister hugged him also, so he was a much-embraced young
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Am I not a man of business, Maude?&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t buy &rsquo;em&mdash;you must breed &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
One shilling with the basket.&nbsp; I shook him in the first
round, and he never rallied after.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a dear good boy.&nbsp; You did
splendidly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the way to handle &rsquo;em.&nbsp; He saw
that I was a real fizzer and full of blood.&nbsp; One business
man can tell another at a glance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude laughed, for Jack, with his cavalry swagger and a white
weal all round his sunburned face to show where his chin-strap
hung, looked the most unbusiness-like of mortals.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you offer forty pounds?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you have to begin somewhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why forty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because it is what we offer when we are buying the
hairies&mdash;trooper&rsquo;s chargers, you know.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a great thing to have a fixed rule in business.&nbsp;
I never go higher than forty&mdash;rule one, section one, and no
exceptions in the margin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They lunched together at the Holborn, and Jack took Maude
afterwards to what he called &lsquo;a real instructive
show,&rsquo; which proved to be a horse-sale at
Tattersall&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They then drove back to the
lawyer&rsquo;s, and there they found a letter waiting addressed
to Mrs. Crosse.&nbsp; Maude tore it open.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Mrs. Crosse,&rsquo; said this delightful note,
&lsquo;I am happy to be able to inform you that the directors
have decided to stop the legal proceedings, and to accept your
offer of forty pounds in full satisfaction of all claims due
against your husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude, Jack, and the good Owen performed a triumphant <i>pas
de trois</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have done splendidly, Mrs. Crosse,
splendidly!&rsquo; cried Owen.&nbsp; &lsquo;I never heard a
better day&rsquo;s work in my life.&nbsp; Now, if you will give
me your cheque and wait here, I will go over and settle
everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And please bring the bond back with you,&rsquo; said
Maude.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>So it was that Frank, coming down upon the morning of his
birthday, perceived a pretty silver cigarette-box laid in front
of his plate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this for me, my darling?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Frank, a wee present from your wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How sweet of you!&nbsp; I never saw such a lovely
case.&nbsp; Why, there&rsquo;s something inside it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cigarettes, I suppose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it is a paper of some kind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hotspur
Insurance Company.&rdquo;&nbsp; Good Lord, I never seem for one
instant to be able to shake that infernal thing off!&nbsp; How on
earth did it get in there?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
this?&mdash;&ldquo;I hereby guarantee to you&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; Maude, Maude, what have you been
doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear old boy,&rsquo; she cried, as she put her arms
round him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear old boy!&nbsp; Oh, I <i>do</i> feel
so happy!&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>THE
BROWNING SOCIETY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> all began by Mrs. Hunt Mortimer,
the smart little up-to-date wife of the solicitor, saying to Mrs.
Beecher, the young bride of the banker, that in a place like
Woking it was very hard to get any mental friction, or to escape
from the same eternal grooves of thought and conversation.&nbsp;
The same idea, it seemed, had occurred to Mrs. Beecher, fortified
by a remark from the <i>Lady&rsquo;s Journal</i> that an internal
intellectual life was the surest method by which a woman could
preserve her youth.&nbsp; She turned up the article&mdash;for the
conversation occurred in her drawing-room&mdash;and she read
extracts from it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shakespeare as a Cosmetic&rsquo;
was the title.&nbsp; Maude was very much struck, and before they
separated they had formed themselves into a Literary Society
which should meet and discuss classical authors every Wednesday
afternoon at each other&rsquo;s houses.&nbsp; That one hour of
concentrated thought and lofty impulse should give a dignity and
a tone to the whole dull provincial week.</p>
<p>What should they read?&nbsp; It was well that they should
decide it before they separated, so as to start fair upon the
next Wednesday.&nbsp; Maude suggested Shakespeare, but Mrs. Hunt
Mortimer thought that a good deal of it was improper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does it matter?&rsquo; said Mrs. Beecher.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We are all married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still I don&rsquo;t think it would be quite
nice,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hunt Mortimer.&nbsp; She belonged to the
extreme right on matters of propriety.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But surely Mr. Bowdler made Shakespeare quite
respectable,&rsquo; Mrs. Beecher argued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did his work very carelessly.&nbsp; He left in much
that might be dispensed with, and he omitted a good deal which
was quite innocent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I once got two copies and read all the
omissions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you do that?&rsquo; asked Maude
mischievously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I wanted to make sure that they <i>had</i> been
omitted,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hunt Mortimer severely.</p>
<p>Mrs. Beecher stooped and picked an invisible hairpin out of
the rug.&nbsp; Mrs. Hunt Mortimer continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is Byron, of course.&nbsp; But he is so very
suggestive.&nbsp; There are passages in his
works&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could never see any harm in them,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Beecher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is because you did not know where to look,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Hunt Mortimer.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you have a copy in the
house, Mrs. Beecher, I will undertake to make it abundantly clear
to you that he is to be eschewed by those who wish to keep their
thoughts unsullied.&nbsp; Not?&nbsp; I fancy that even quoting
from memory I could convince you that it is better to avoid
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pass Byron,&rsquo; said Mrs. Beecher, who was a very
pretty little kittenish person, with no apparent need of any
cosmetics, literary or otherwise.&nbsp; &lsquo;How about
Shelley?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frank raves about Shelley,&rsquo; observed Maude.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunt Mortimer shook her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His work has some dreadful tendencies.&nbsp; He was, I
am informed, either a theist or an atheist, I cannot for the
moment recall which&mdash;I think that we should make our little
course as improving as possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tennyson,&rsquo; Maude suggested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been told that his meaning is too clear to
entitle him to rank among the great thinkers of our race.&nbsp;
The lofty thought is necessarily obscure.&nbsp; There is no merit
in following a poem which is perfectly intelligible.&nbsp; Which
leads us to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Browning!&rsquo; cried the other ladies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly.&nbsp; We might form a little Browning Society
of our own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charming!&nbsp; Charming!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so it was agreed.</p>
<p>There was only one other point to be settled at this their
inaugural meeting, which was, to choose the other ladies who
should be admitted into their literary circle.&nbsp; There were
to be no men.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They do distract one so,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hunt
Mortimer.</p>
<p>The great thing was to admit no one save those earnest spirits
who would aspire to get the full benefit from their
studies.&nbsp; Mrs. Fortescue could not be thought of, she was
much too talkative.&nbsp; And Mrs. Jones had such a frivolous
mind.&nbsp; Mrs. Charles could think and talk of nothing but her
servants.&nbsp; And Mrs. Patt-Beatson always wanted to lay down
the law.&nbsp; Perhaps on the whole it would be better to start
the society quietly among themselves, and then gradually to
increase it.&nbsp; The first meeting should be next Wednesday, at
Mrs. Crosse&rsquo;s house, and Mrs. Hunt Mortimer would bring her
complete two-volume edition with her.&nbsp; Mrs. Beecher thought
that one volume would be enough just at first, but Mrs. Hunt
Mortimer said that it was better to have a wide choice.&nbsp;
Maude went home and told Frank in the evening.&nbsp; He was
pleased, but rather sceptical.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must begin with the simpler things first,&rsquo;
said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should recommend <i>Herv&eacute; Riel</i>
and <i>Gold Hair</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Maude put on the charming air of displeasure which became
her so well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are serious students, sir,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We want the very hardest poem in the book.&nbsp; I assure
you, Frank, that one of your little faults is that you always
underrate a woman&rsquo;s intelligence.&nbsp; Mrs. Hunt Mortimer
says that though we may be less original than men, we are more
assim&mdash; more assmun&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Assimulative.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I say&mdash;assimulative.&nbsp; Now,
you always talk as if&mdash;oh yes, you do!&nbsp; No, you
mustn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; How absurd you are, Frank!&nbsp; Whenever I
try to speak seriously to you, you always do that and spoil
everything.&nbsp; How would you like to discuss Browning if at
the end of every sentence somebody came and kissed you?&nbsp; You
wouldn&rsquo;t mind!&nbsp; No, I dare say not.&nbsp; But you
would feel that you were not being taken seriously.&nbsp; Wait
till the next time <i>you</i> are in earnest about
anything&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The meeting was to be at three o&rsquo;clock, and at ten
minutes to the hour Mrs. Hunt Mortimer arrived with two large
brown volumes under her arm.&nbsp; She had come early, she said,
because there was to be a rehearsal of the amateur theatricals at
the Dixons&rsquo; at a quarter-past four.&nbsp; Mrs. Beecher did
not appear until five minutes after the hour.&nbsp; Her cook had
quarrelled with the housemaid, and given instantaneous notice,
with five people coming to dinner on Saturday.&nbsp; It had upset
the lady very much, and she explained that she would not have
come if she had not promised.&nbsp; It was so difficult to follow
poetry when you were thinking about the entr&eacute;e all the
time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why the entr&eacute;e?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Hunt Mortimer,
looking up from the book which she held open in front of her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Beecher, who had the art of
saying the most simple things as if they were profoundly
confidential secrets,&mdash;&lsquo;My dear, my parlourmaid is
really an excellent cook, and I shall rely upon her if Martha
really goes.&nbsp; But she is limited, very limited, and
entr&eacute;es and savouries are the two things in which I cannot
entirely trust her.&nbsp; I must, therefore, find some dish which
is well within her capacity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunt Mortimer prided herself upon her housekeeping, so
the problem interested her.&nbsp; Maude also began to feel the
meeting less dull than she had expected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course there are many things to be
considered,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hunt Mortimer, with the air of a
Q.C. giving an opinion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oyster patties or oyster
vol-au-vents&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oysters are out of season,&rsquo; said Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was about to say,&rsquo; Mrs. Hunt Mortimer
continued, with admirable presence of mind, &lsquo;that these
entr&eacute;es of oysters are inadmissible because they are out
of season.&nbsp; Now curried prawns&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My husband loathes them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well!&nbsp; What do you say to sweetbreads en
caisse?&nbsp; All you want are chopped mushrooms, shalots,
parsley, nutmeg, pepper, salt, breadcrumb, bacon
fat&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Beecher despairingly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Anne would never remember all that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cutlets &agrave; la Constance,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hunt
Mortimer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sure that they are simple
enough.&nbsp; Cutlets, butter, fowls&rsquo; livers, cocks&rsquo;
combs, mushrooms&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, my dear, remember that she is only a
parlourmaid.&nbsp; It is unreasonable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ragout of fowl, chicken patties, croquettes of veal
with a little browning&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got back to Browning after all,&rsquo;
cried Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said Mrs. Beecher, &lsquo;it is all my
fault, and I am so sorry.&nbsp; Now, Mrs. Hunt Mortimer, do
please read us a little of that delightful poetry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can always get small entr&eacute;es sent down from
the Stores,&rsquo; cried Maude, as a happy thought.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You dear, good girl, how sweet of you to think of
it.&nbsp; Of course one can.&nbsp; That is really an admirable
idea.&nbsp; There now, we may consider the entr&eacute;e as being
removed, so we proceed to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Hunt Mortimer solemnly, glancing down the index of the
first volume.&nbsp; &lsquo;I confess that my acquaintance with
the poet has up to now been rather superficial.&nbsp; Our
ambition must be to so master him that he becomes from this time
forward part and parcel of ourselves.&nbsp; I fancy that the
difficulties in understanding him have been very much
exaggerated, and that with goodwill and perseverance we shall
manage to overcome them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a relief to Mrs. Beecher and to Maude to realise that
Mrs. Hunt Mortimer knew no more about the matter than
themselves.&nbsp; They both ventured upon a less diffident air
now that it was clear that it might be done in safety.&nbsp;
Maude frowned thoughtfully, and Mrs. Beecher cast up her pretty
brown eyes at the curtain-rod, as if she were running over in her
memory the whole long catalogue of the poet&rsquo;s works.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you what we should do,&rsquo; said
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;We must make a vow that we shall never pass a
line until we understand it.&nbsp; We will go over it again and
again until we grasp its meaning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What an excellent idea!&rsquo; cried Maude, with one of
her little bursts of enthusiasm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now that is really
splendid, Mrs. Beecher.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My friends always call me Nellie,&rsquo; said the
little brunette.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How nice of you to say so!&nbsp; I should love to call
you so, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&nbsp; It is such a pretty name
too.&nbsp; Only you must call me Maude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You look like a Maude,&rsquo; said Mrs. Beecher.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I always picture a Maude as bright and pretty and
blonde.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it strange how names associate
themselves with characters.&nbsp; Mary is always domestic, and
Rose is a flirt, and Elizabeth is dutiful, and Evelyn is dashing,
and Alice is colourless, and Helen is masterful&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Matilda is impatient,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hunt
Mortimer, laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Matilda has reason to be, seated
here with an index in front of her while you two are exchanging
compliments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, we were waiting for you to begin,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Beecher reproachfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do let us have something, for
really the time is slipping away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be a pity to begin at the beginning, because
that represents his immature genius,&rsquo; remarked Mrs. Hunt
Mortimer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think that on this the opening day of
the Society, we should have the poet at his best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How are we to know which <i>is</i> his best?&rsquo;
Maude asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be inclined to choose something with a title
which suggests profundity&mdash;&ldquo;A Pretty Woman,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Love in a Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;Any Wife to any
Husband&rdquo;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, what <i>did</i> she say to him?&rsquo; cried
Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I was about to say that all these subjects rather
suggested frivolity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides, it really is a very absurd title,&rsquo;
remarked Mrs. Beecher, who was fond of generalising from her six
months&rsquo; experience of matrimony.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>A</i>
husband to <i>a</i> wife&rsquo; would be intelligible, but how
can you know what <i>any</i> husband would say to <i>any</i>
wife?&nbsp; No one can really foretell what a man will do.&nbsp;
They really are such extraordinary creatures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Hunt Mortimer had been married for five years, and
felt as competent to lay down the law about husbands as about
entr&eacute;es.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you have had a larger experience of them, dear,
you will find that there is usually a reason, or at least a
primitive instinct of some sort, at the root of their
actions.&nbsp; But, seriously, we must really concentrate our
attention upon the poet, for my other engagement will call me
away at four, which only leaves me ten minutes to reach
Maybury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Beecher and Maude settled down with anxious attention
upon their faces.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do please go on!&rsquo; they cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here is &ldquo;The Pied Piper of
Hamelin.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now that interests me more than I can tell,&rsquo;
cried Maude, with her eyes shining with pleasure.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do
please read us everything there is about that dear
piper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why so?&rsquo; asked her two companions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the fact is,&rsquo; said Maude,
&lsquo;Frank&mdash;my husband, you know&mdash;came to a
fancy-dress at St. Albans as the Pied Piper.&nbsp; I had no idea
that it came from Browning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did he dress for it?&rsquo; asked Mrs.
Beecher.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are invited to the Aston&rsquo;s dress
ball, and I want something suitable for George.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a most charming dress.&nbsp; Red and black all
over, something like Mephistopheles, you know, and a peaked hat
with a bell at the top.&nbsp; Then he had a flute, of course, and
a thin wire from his waist with a stuffed rat at the end of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A rat!&nbsp; How horrid!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that was the story, you know.&nbsp; The rats all
followed the Pied Piper, and so this rat followed Frank.&nbsp; He
put it in his pocket when he danced, but once he forgot, and so
it got stood upon, and the sawdust came out all over the
floor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunt Mortimer was also invited to the dress ball, and her
thoughts flew away from the book in front of her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you go, Mrs. Crosse?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went as &ldquo;Night.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! you with your brown hair!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, father said that I was not a very dark
night.&nbsp; I was in black, you know, just my ordinary black
silk dinner-dress.&nbsp; Then I had a silver half-moon over my
head, and black veils round my hair, and stars all over my bodice
and skirt, with a long comet right across the front.&nbsp; Father
upset a cup of milk over me at supper, and said afterwards that
it was the milky way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is simply maddening how men <i>will</i> make jokes
about the most important subjects,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hunt
Mortimer.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I have no doubt, dear, that your dress
was an exceedingly effective one.&nbsp; Now, for my own part, I
had some idea of going as the &ldquo;Duchess of
Devonshire.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charming!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Beecher and Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not a very difficult costume, you know.&nbsp; I
have some old Point d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on lace which has been in
the family for a century.&nbsp; I make it the starting-point of
my costume.&nbsp; The gown need not be very
elaborate&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silk?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Beecher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I thought that perhaps a white-flowered
brocade&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, with pearl trimming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, dear, with my lace for trimming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course.&nbsp; You said so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then a muslin fichu coming over here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How perfectly sweet!&rsquo; cried Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the waist cut high, and ruffles at the
sleeves.&nbsp; And, of course, a picture hat&mdash;you know what
I mean&mdash;with a curling ostrich feather.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Powdered hair, of course?&rsquo; said Mrs. Beecher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Powdered in ringlets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will suit you admirably&mdash;beautifully.&nbsp; You
are tall enough to carry it off, and you have the figure
also.&nbsp; How I wish I was equally certain about my
own!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What had you thought of, dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I had some idea about
&ldquo;Ophelia.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do you think that it would
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; Had you worked it out at
all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Beecher, relapsing into
her pleasant confidential manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had some views,
but, of course, I should be so glad to have your opinion about
it.&nbsp; I only saw <i>Hamlet</i> once, and the lady was dressed
in white, with a gauzy light nun&rsquo;s-veiling over it.&nbsp; I
thought that with white pongee silk as an under-dress, and then
some sort of delicate&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Crepe de Chine,&rsquo; Maude suggested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But in Ophelia&rsquo;s day such a thing had never been
heard of,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hunt Mortimer.&nbsp; &lsquo;A net of
silver thread&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Beecher, &lsquo;with some
sort of jewelling upon it.&nbsp; That was just what I had
imagined.&nbsp; Of course it should be cut classically and
draped&mdash;my dressmaker is such a treasure&mdash;and I should
have a gold embroidery upon the white silk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Crewel work,&rsquo; said Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or a plain cross-stitch pattern.&nbsp; Then a tiara of
pearls on the head.&nbsp; Shakespeare&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the name of the poet their three consciences pricked
simultaneously.&nbsp; They looked at each other and then at the
clock with dismay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must&mdash;we really <i>must</i> go on with our
reading,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Hunt Mortimer.&nbsp; &lsquo;How did we
get talking about these dresses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was my fault,&rsquo; said Mrs. Beecher, looking
contrite.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, dear, it was mine,&rsquo; said Maude.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You remember it all came from my saying that Frank had
gone to the ball as the Pied Piper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to read the very first poem that I
open,&rsquo; said Mrs. Hunt Mortimer remorselessly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am afraid that it is almost time that I started, but we
may still be able to skim over a few pages.&nbsp; Now then!&nbsp;
There!&nbsp; <i>Setebos</i>!&nbsp; What a funny name!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What <i>does</i> it mean?&rsquo; asked Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall find out, no doubt, as we proceed,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Hunt Mortimer.&nbsp; &lsquo;We shall take it line by line
and draw the full meaning from it.&nbsp; The first line
is&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Will sprawl now that the heat of day is
best&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Who will?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Beecher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what it
says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next line will explain, no doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Flat on his&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me, I had no idea that Browning was like
this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do read it, dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t possibly think of doing so.&nbsp; With
your permission we will pass on to the next paragraph.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we vowed not to skip.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why read what cannot instruct or elevate us.&nbsp;
Let us begin this next stanza, and hope for something
better.&nbsp; The first line is&mdash;I wonder if it really can
be as it is written.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do please read it!&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Setebos and Setebos and Setebos.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three students looked sadly at each other.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This is worse than anything I could have imagined,&rsquo;
said the reader.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We mast skip that line.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we are skipping everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a person&rsquo;s name,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Beecher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or three persons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, only one, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why should he repeat it three times?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For emphasis!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Mrs. Beecher, &lsquo;it was Mr.
Setebos, and Mrs. Setebos, and a little Setebos.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, if you are going to make fun, I won&rsquo;t
read.&nbsp; But I think we were wrong to say that we would take
it line by line.&nbsp; It would be easier sentence by
sentence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then we will include the next line, which finishes the
sentence.&nbsp; It is, &ldquo;thinketh he dwelleth in the cold of
the moon.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it <i>was</i> only one Setebos!&rsquo; cried
Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it appears.&nbsp; It is easy to understand if one
will only put it into ordinary language.&nbsp; This person
Setebos was under the impression that his life was spent in the
moonlight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what nonsense it is!&rsquo; cried Mrs.
Beecher.&nbsp; Mrs. Hunt Mortimer looked at her
reproachfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is very easy to call everything
which we do not understand &ldquo;nonsense,&rdquo;&rsquo; said
she.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have no doubt that Browning had a profound
meaning in this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was it, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hunt Mortimer looked at the clock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry to have to go,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;but really I have no choice in the matter.&nbsp; Just as
we were getting on so nicely&mdash;it is really most
vexatious.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll come to my house next Wednesday,
Mrs. Crosse, won&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; And you also, Mrs.
Beecher.&nbsp; Good-bye, and thanks for <i>such</i> a pleasant
afternoon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But her skirts had hardly ceased to rustle in the passage
before the Browning Society had been dissolved by a
two-thirds&rsquo; vote of the total membership.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the use?&rsquo; cried Mrs. Beecher.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Two lines have positively made my head ache, and there are
two volumes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must change our poet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His verbosity!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Beecher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His Setebosity!&rsquo; cried Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And dear Mrs. Hunt Mortimer pretending to like
him!&nbsp; Shall we propose Tennyson next week?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be far better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Tennyson is quite simple, is he not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfectly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why should we meet to discuss him if there is
nothing to discuss?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean that we might as well each read him for
herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it would be easier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, of course it would.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so after one hour of precarious life, Mrs. Hunt
Mortimer&rsquo;s Mutual Improvement Society for the elucidation
of Browning came to an untimely end.</p>
<h2><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>AN
INVESTMENT</h2>
<p>&lsquo;I <span class="smcap">want</span> your advice,
Maude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was looking very sweet and fresh in the morning
sunlight.&nbsp; She wore a flowered, French print
blouse&mdash;little sprigs of roses on a white
background&mdash;and a lace frill round her pretty, white, smooth
throat.&nbsp; The buckle of her brown leather belt just gleamed
over the edge of the table-cloth.&nbsp; In front of her were a
litter of correspondence, a white cup of coffee, and two empty
eggshells&mdash;for she was a perfectly healthy young animal with
an excellent appetite.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, dear, what is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall take the later train.&nbsp; Then I need not
hurry, and can walk down at my ease.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How nice of you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not sure that Dinton will think so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only one little hour of difference&mdash;what can it
matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They don&rsquo;t run offices on those lines.&nbsp; An
hour means a good deal in the City of London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I do hate the City of London!&nbsp; It is the only
thing which ever comes between us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose that it separates a good many loving couples
every morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had come across and an egg-cup had been upset.&nbsp; Then
he had been scolded, and they sat together laughing upon the
sofa.&nbsp; When he had finished admiring her little, shining,
patent-leather, Louis shoes and the two charming curves of
open-work black stocking, she reminded him that he had asked for
her advice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear, what was it?&rsquo;&nbsp; She knitted her
brows and tried to look as her father did when he considered a
matter of business.&nbsp; But then her father was not hampered by
having a young man&rsquo;s arm round his neck.&nbsp; It is so
hard to be business-like when any one is curling one&rsquo;s hair
round his finger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have some money to invest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, how clever of you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only fifty pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, dear, it is a beginning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is what I feel.&nbsp; It is the foundation-stone
of our fortunes.&nbsp; And so I want Her Majesty to lay
it&mdash;mustn&rsquo;t wrinkle your brow though&mdash;that is not
allowed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is a great responsibility, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, we must not lose it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, dear, we must not lose it.&nbsp; Suppose we invest
it in one of those modern fifty-guinea pianos.&nbsp; Our dear old
Broadwood was an excellent piano when I was a girl, but it is
getting so squeaky in the upper notes.&nbsp; Perhaps they would
allow us something for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that we want one very badly, dear.&nbsp; And
such a musician as you are should have the best instrument that
money can buy.&nbsp; I promise you that when we have a little to
turn round on, you shall have a beauty.&nbsp; But in the meantime
we must not buy anything with this money&mdash;I mean nothing for
ourselves&mdash;we must invest it.&nbsp; We cannot tell what
might happen.&nbsp; I might fall ill.&nbsp; I might
die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, how horrid you are this morning!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we have to be ready for anything.&nbsp; So I want
to put this where we can get it on an emergency, and where in the
meantime it will bring us some interest.&nbsp; Now what shall we
buy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa always bought a house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we have not enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a little house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not the smallest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A mortgage, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sum is too small.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Government stock, Frank&mdash;if you think it is
safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it is safe enough.&nbsp; But the interest is so
low.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much should we get?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I suppose the fifty pounds would bring us in
about thirty shillings a year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thirty shillings!&nbsp; O Frank!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather less than more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fancy a great rich nation like ours taking our fifty
pounds and treating us like that.&nbsp; How <i>mean</i> of
them!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let them have it, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they want it, they can make us a fair offer for
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think we&rsquo;ll try something else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, they have only themselves to thank.&nbsp; But you
have some plan in your head, Frank.&nbsp; What is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He brought the morning paper over from the table.&nbsp; Then
he folded it so as to bring the financial columns to the top.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw a fellow in the City yesterday who knows a great
deal about gold-mining.&nbsp; I only had a few minutes&rsquo;
talk, but he strongly advised me to have some shares in the El
Dorado Proprietary Gold Mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a nice name!&nbsp; I wonder if they would let us
have any?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, they are to be bought in the open market.&nbsp;
It is like this, Maude.&nbsp; The mine was a very good one, and
paid handsome dividends.&nbsp; Then it had some
misfortunes.&nbsp; First, there was no water, and then there was
too much water, and the workings were flooded.&nbsp; So, of
course, the price of the shares fell.&nbsp; Now they are getting
the mine all right again, but the shares are still low.&nbsp; It
certainly seems a very good chance to pick a few of them
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are they very dear, Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I looked them up in the <i>Mining Register</i> before I
came home yesterday.&nbsp; The original price of each share was
ten shillings, but as they have had these misfortunes, one would
expect to find them rather lower.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ten shillings!&nbsp; It does not seem much to pay for a
share in a thing with a name like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here it is,&rsquo; said he, pointing with a pencil to
one name in a long printed list.&nbsp; &lsquo;This one, between
the Royal Bonanza and the Alabaster Consols.&nbsp; You
see&mdash;El Dorado Proprietary!&nbsp; Then after it you have
printed, 4&frac34;&mdash;4&#8542;.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t profess to
know much about these things, but that of course means the
price.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear, it is printed at the top of the
column&mdash;&ldquo;Yesterday&rsquo;s prices.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quito so.&nbsp; Well, we know that the original price
of each share was ten shillings, and of course they must have
dropped with a flood in the mine, so that these figures must mean
that the price yesterday was four shillings and nine-pence, or
thereabouts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a clear head for business you have,
dear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think we can&rsquo;t do wrong in buying at that
price.&nbsp; You see, with our fifty pounds we could buy two
hundred of them, and then if they went up again we could sell,
and take our profit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How delightful!&nbsp; But suppose they don&rsquo;t go
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, they can&rsquo;t go down.&nbsp; I should not
think that a share at four shillings and ninepence <i>could</i>
go down very much.&nbsp; There is no room.&nbsp; But it may go up
to any extent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides, your friend said that they would go
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, he seemed quite confident about it.&nbsp; Well,
what do you think, Maude?&nbsp; Is it good enough or
not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, I hardly dare advise you.&nbsp; Just imagine
if we were to lose it all.&nbsp; Do you think it would be wiser
to get a hundred shares, and then we could buy twenty-five
pounds&rsquo; worth of Royal Bonanza as well.&nbsp; It would be
impossible for them both to go wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Royal Bonanza shares are dear, and then we have had
no information about it.&nbsp; I think we had better back our own
opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then that is settled.&nbsp; I have a telegraph-form
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could you not buy them yourself when you are in
town?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you can&rsquo;t buy things yourself.&nbsp; You have
to do it through a broker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always thought a broker was a horrid man, who came
and took your furniture away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s another kind of broker.&nbsp; He comes
afterwards.&nbsp; I promised Harrison that he should have any
business which I could put in his way, so here goes.&nbsp; How is
that?&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Harrison, 13a Throgmorton Street,
E.C.&mdash;Buy two hundred El Dorado Proprietaries.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Crosse</span>, Woking.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it sound rather peremptory,
Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, that is mere business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope he won&rsquo;t be offended.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I can answer for that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have not said the price.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One cannot say the price because one does not know
it.&nbsp; You see, it is always going up and down.&nbsp; By this
time it may be a little higher or a little lower than
yesterday.&nbsp; There cannot be much change, that is
certain.&nbsp; Great Scot, Maude, it is ten-fifteen.&nbsp; Three
and a half minutes for a quarter of a mile.&nbsp; Good-bye,
darling!&nbsp; I just love you in that bodice.&nbsp; O
Lord&mdash;good-bye!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&lsquo;Well, has anything happened?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you have come back.&nbsp; Oh I am so glad to see
you, you dear old boy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care of that window, darling!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my goodness, I hope he didn&rsquo;t see.&nbsp; No,
it&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; He was looking the other way.&nbsp;
We have the gold shares all right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harrison has telegraphed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, here it is.&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Crosse, The Lindens, Woking.&mdash;Bought
two hundred El Dorados at 4&frac34;.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Harrison</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;That is capital.&nbsp; I rather expected to see
Harrison in the train.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he
calls on his way from the station.&nbsp; He has to pass our door,
you know, on his way to Maybury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is sure to call.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you holding there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a paper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What paper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is it who talks about woman&rsquo;s
curiosity?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me see it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, if you must know, it is the <i>Financial
Whisper</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where in the world did you get it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew that the Montresors took a financial
paper.&nbsp; I remember Mrs. Montresor saying once how dreadfully
dry it was.&nbsp; So when you were gone I sent Jemima round and
borrowed it, and I have read it right through to see if there was
anything about our mine in it&mdash;<i>our</i> mine, Frank; does
it not sound splendid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, is there anything?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She clapped her hands with delight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, there is.&nbsp; &ldquo;This prosperous
mine&mdash;&rdquo; that is what it says.&nbsp; Look here, it is
under the heading of Australian Notes,&rsquo; she held out the
paper and pointed, but his face fell as he looked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Maude, it&rsquo;s preposterous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is preposterous?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The word is preposterous and not
prosperous&mdash;&ldquo;this preposterous mine.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frank!&rsquo;&nbsp; She turned her face away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, dear!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the
odds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, our first investment&mdash;our fifty
pounds!&nbsp; And to think that I should have kept the paper as a
surprise for you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the print is a little slurred, and it was a very
natural mistake.&nbsp; After all, the paper may be wrong.&nbsp;
Oh don&rsquo;t, Maude, please don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not
worth it&mdash;all the gold on the earth is not worth it.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a sweet girlie!&nbsp; Now, are you better?&nbsp;
Oh, damn those open curtains!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A tall and brisk young man with a glossy hat was coming
through the garden.&nbsp; An instant later Jemima had ushered him
in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hullo, Harrison!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you do, Crosse?&nbsp; How are you, Mrs.
Crosse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you do?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll just order tea if you
will excuse me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ordering tea seemed to involve a good deal of splashing
water.&nbsp; Maude came back with a merrier face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this a good paper, Mr. Harrison?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&nbsp; <i>Financial Whisper</i>!&nbsp; No,
the most venal rag in the city.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I am so glad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you know, we bought some shares to-day, and it
calls our mine a preposterous one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, is that all.&nbsp; Who cares what the <i>Financial
Whisper</i> says!&nbsp; It would call the Bank of England a
preposterous institution if it thought it could bear Consols by
doing so.&nbsp; Its opinion is not worth a halfpenny.&nbsp; By
the way, Crosse, it was about those shares that I
called.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you might.&nbsp; I have only just got back
myself, and I saw by your wire that you had bought them all
right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I thought I had better let you have your contract
at once.&nbsp; Settling day is on Monday, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I will let you have a
cheque.&nbsp; What&mdash;what&rsquo;s this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The contract had been laid face upwards upon the table.&nbsp;
Frank Crosse&rsquo;s face grew whiter and his eyes larger as he
stared at it.&nbsp; It ran in this way&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">13a <span
class="smcap">Throgmorton Street</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Bought for Francis Crosse, Esq.</p>

<blockquote><p>For the 7th inst.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I fancy there is some mistake here, Harrison,&rsquo;
said he, speaking with a very dry pair of lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A mistake!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, this is not at all what I expected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank!&nbsp; Nearly a thousand pounds!&rsquo; gasped
Maude.</p>
<p>Harrison glanced from one of them to the other.&nbsp; He saw
that the matter was serious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry if there has been any mistake.&nbsp; I
tried to obey your instructions.&nbsp; You wanted two hundred El
Dorados, did you not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, at four and ninepence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Four and ninepence!&nbsp; They are four pound fifteen
each.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I read that they were only ten shillings
originally, and that they had been falling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, they have been falling for months.&nbsp; But they
were as high as ten pounds once.&nbsp; They are down at four
pound fifteen now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why on earth could the paper not say so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When a fraction is used, it always means a fraction of
a pound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heavens!&nbsp; And I have to find this sum before
Monday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monday is settling day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do it, Harrison.&nbsp; It is
impossible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then there is the obvious alternative.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I had rather die.&nbsp; I will never go
bankrupt&mdash;never!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harrison began to laugh, and then turned stonily solemn as he
met a pair of reproachful grey eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It strikes me that you have not done much at this game,
Crosse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never before&mdash;and by Heaven, never
again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You take it much too hard.&nbsp; When I spoke of an
alternative, I never dreamed of bankruptcy.&nbsp; All you have to
do is to sell your stock to-morrow morning, and pay the
difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can I do that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather.&nbsp; Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What would the difference be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harrison took an evening paper from his pocket.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We deal in rails chiefly, and I don&rsquo;t profess to
keep in touch with the mining market.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll find the
quotation here.&nbsp; By Jove!&rsquo;&nbsp; He whistled between
his teeth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Frank, and felt his wife&rsquo;s
little warm palm fall upon his hand under the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The difference is in your favour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In my favour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, listen to this.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mining markets,
both the South African and the Australian, opened dull, but grew
more animated as the day proceeded, prices closing at the
best.&nbsp; Out crops upon the Rand mark a general advance of
one-sixteenth to one-eighth.&nbsp; The chief feature in the
Australian section was a sharp advance of five-eighths in El
Dorados, upon a telegram that the workings had been pumped
dry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Crosse, I congratulate you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can really sell them for more than I gave?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think so.&nbsp; You have two hundred of them,
and a profit of ten shillings on each.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maude, we&rsquo;ll have the whisky and the soda.&nbsp;
Harrison, you must have a drink.&nbsp; Why, that&rsquo;s a
hundred pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More than a hundred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Without my paying anything?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a penny.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When does the Exchange open to-morrow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The rattle goes at eleven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, be there at eleven, Harrison.&nbsp; Sell them at
once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t hold on and watch the
market?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no&mdash;I won&rsquo;t have an easy moment until
they are sold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, my boy.&nbsp; You can rely upon me.&nbsp;
You will get a cheque for your balance on Tuesday or
Wednesday.&nbsp; Good evening!&nbsp; I am so glad that it has all
ended well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the joke of it is, Maude,&rsquo; said her husband,
after they had talked over the whole adventure from the
beginning.&nbsp; &lsquo;The joke of it is that we have still to
find an investment for our original fifty pounds.&nbsp; I am
inclined to put it into Consols after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Maude, &lsquo;perhaps it would be the
patriotic thing to do.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Two days later the poor old Broadwood with the squeaky treble
and the wheezy bass was banished for ever from The Lindens, and
there arrived in its place a ninety-five-guinea cottage grand,
all dark walnut and gilding, with notes in it so deep and rich
and resonant that Maude could sit before it by the hour and find
music enough in simply touching one here and one there, and
listening to the soft, sweet, reverberant tones which came
swelling from its depths.&nbsp; Her El Dorado piano, she called
it, and tried to explain to lady visitors how her husband had
been so clever at business that he had earned it in a single
day.&nbsp; As she was never very clear in her own mind how the
thing had occurred, she never succeeded in explaining it to any
one else, but a vague and solemn impression became gradually
diffused abroad that young Mr. Frank Crosse was a very remarkable
man, and that he had done something exceedingly clever in the
matter of an Australian mine.</p>
<h2><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>A
THUNDERCLOUD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Blue</span> skies and shining sun, but far
down on the horizon one dark cloud gathers and drifts slowly
upwards unobserved.&nbsp; Frank Crosse was aware of its shadow
when coming down to breakfast he saw an envelope with a
well-remembered handwriting beside his plate.&nbsp; How he had
loved that writing once, how his heart had warmed and quickened
at the sight of it, how eagerly he had read it&mdash;and now a
viper coiled upon the white table-cloth would hardly have given
him a greater shock.&nbsp; Contradictory, incalculable, whimsical
life!&nbsp; A year ago how scornfully he would have laughed, what
contemptuous unbelief would have filled his soul, if he had been
told that any letter of hers could have struck him cold with the
vague apprehension of coming misfortune.&nbsp; He tore off the
envelope and threw it into the fire.&nbsp; But before he could
glance at the letter there was the quick patter of his
wife&rsquo;s feet upon the stair, and she burst, full of girlish
health and high spirits, into the little room.&nbsp; She wore a
pink crepon dressing-gown, with cream guipure lace at the neck
and wrists.&nbsp; Pink ribbon outlined her trim waist.&nbsp; The
morning sun shone upon her, and she seemed to him to be the
daintiest, sweetest tiling upon earth.&nbsp; He had thrust his
letter into his pocket as she entered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will excuse the dressing-gown, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I just love you in it.&nbsp; No, you mustn&rsquo;t
pass.&nbsp; Now you can go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was so afraid that you would breakfast without me
that I had no time to dress.&nbsp; I shall have the whole day to
finish in when you are gone.&nbsp; There now&mdash;Jemima has
forgotten to warm the plates again!&nbsp; And your coffee is
cold.&nbsp; I wish you had not waited.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better cold coffee with Maude&rsquo;s
society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always thought men gave up complimenting their wives
after they married them.&nbsp; I am so glad you
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I think on the whole that women&rsquo;s ideas
of men are unfair and severe.&nbsp; The reason is that the women
who have met unpleasant men run about and make a noise, but the
women who are happy just keep quiet and enjoy themselves.&nbsp;
For example, I have not time to write a book explaining to every
one how nice Frank Crosse is; but if he were nasty my life would
be empty, and so of course I should write my book.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel such a fraud when you talk like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is part of your niceness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh don&rsquo;t, Maude!&nbsp; It really hurts
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Frank, what is the matter with you
to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing, dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, there is.&nbsp; I can tell easily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I am not quite myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I am sure that you are not.&nbsp; I believe that
you have a cold coming on.&nbsp; O Frank, do take some ammoniated
quinine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heavens, no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please!&nbsp; Please!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear girlie, there is nothing the matter with
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is such splendid stuff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I know.&nbsp; But really I don&rsquo;t want
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you had any letters, Frank?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything important?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have hardly glanced at it yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Glance at it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I will keep it for the train.&nbsp; Good-bye,
dearest.&nbsp; It is time that I was off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you would only take the ammoniated quinine.&nbsp;
You men are so proud and obstinate.&nbsp; Good-bye,
darling.&nbsp; Eight hours, and then I shall begin to live
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had a quiet corner of a carriage to himself, so he unfolded
his letter and read it.&nbsp; Then he read it again with frowning
brows and compressed lips.&nbsp; It ran in this way&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dearest
Frankie</span>,&mdash;I suppose that I should not address you
like this now that you are a good little married man, but the
force of custom is strong, and, after all, I knew you long before
she did.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose you were aware of it, but
there was a time when I could very easily have made you marry me,
in spite of all you may know about my trivial life and
adventures, but I thought it all over very carefully, and I came
to the conclusion that it was not good enough.&nbsp; You were
always a dear good chap yourself, but your prospects were not
quite dashing enough for your festive Violet.&nbsp; I believe in
a merry time even if it is a short one.&nbsp; But if I had really
wanted to settle down in a humdrum sort of way, you are the man
whom I should have chosen out of the whole batch of them.&nbsp; I
hope what I say won&rsquo;t make you conceited, for one of your
best points used to be your modesty.</p>
<p>But for all that, my dear Frankie, I by no means give you up
altogether, and don&rsquo;t you make any mistake about
that.&nbsp; It was only yesterday that I saw Charlie Scott, and
he told me all about you, and gave me your address.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you bless him?&nbsp; And yet I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; Perhaps you have still a kindly thought of your old
friend, and would like to see her.</p>
<p>But you are going to see her whether you like or not, my dear
boy, so make up your mind to that.&nbsp; You know how you used to
chaff me about my whims.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ve got a whim now,
and I&rsquo;ll have my way as usual.&nbsp; I am going to see you
to-morrow, and if you won&rsquo;t see me under my conditions in
London, I shall call at Woking in the evening.&nbsp; Oh my
goodness, what a bombshell!&nbsp; But you know that I am always
as good as my word.&nbsp; So look out!</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ll give you your orders for the day, and
don&rsquo;t you forget them.&nbsp; To-morrow (Thursday, 14th, no
excuses about the date) you will leave your office at 3.30.&nbsp;
I know that you can when you like.&nbsp; You will drive to
Mariani&rsquo;s, and you will find me at the door.&nbsp; We shall
go up to our old private room, and we shall have tea together,
and a dear old chat about all sorts of things.&nbsp; So
come!&nbsp; But if you don&rsquo;t, there is a train which leaves
Waterloo at 6.10 and reaches Woking at 7.&nbsp; I will come by it
and be just in time for dinner.&nbsp; What a joke it will be!</p>
<p>Good-bye, old boy!&nbsp; I hope your wife does not read your
letters, or this will rather give her fits.&mdash;Yours as
ever,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Violet
Wright</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the first reading this letter filled him with anger.&nbsp;
To be wooed by a very pretty woman is pleasant even to the most
austere of married men (and never again trust the one who denies
it), but to be wooed with a very dangerous threat mixed up with
the wooing is no such pleasant experience.&nbsp; And it was no
empty threat.&nbsp; Violet was a woman who prided herself upon
being as good as her word.&nbsp; She had laughingly said with her
accustomed frankness upon one occasion that it was her sole
remaining virtue.&nbsp; If he did not go to Mariani&rsquo;s, she
would certainly come to Woking.&nbsp; He shuddered to think of
Maude being annoyed by her.&nbsp; It was one thing to speak in a
general way to his wife of prematrimonial experiences, and it was
another to have this woman forcing herself upon her and making a
scene.&nbsp; The idea was so vulgar.&nbsp; The sweet, pure
atmosphere of The Lindens would never be the same again.</p>
<p>No, there was no getting out of it.&nbsp; He must go to
Mariani&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was sufficiently master of himself to
know that no harm could come of that.&nbsp; His absolute love for
his wife shielded him from all danger.&nbsp; The very thought of
infidelity nauseated him.&nbsp; And then, as the idea became more
familiar to him, other emotions succeeded that of anger.&nbsp;
There was an audacity about his old flame, a spirit and
devilment, which appealed to his sporting instincts.&nbsp;
Besides, it was complimentary to him, and flattering to his
masculine vanity, that she should not give him up without a
struggle.&nbsp; Merely as a friend it would not be disagreeable
to see her again.&nbsp; Before he had reached Clapham Junction
his anger had departed, and by the time that he arrived at
Waterloo he was surprised to find himself looking forward to the
interview.</p>
<p>Mariani&rsquo;s is a quiet restaurant, famous for its
<i>lachryma christi spumante</i>, and situated in the network of
sombre streets between Drury Lane and Covent Garden.&nbsp; The
fact of its being in a by-street was not unfavourable to its
particular class of business.&nbsp; Its customers were very free
from the modern vice of self-advertisement, and would even take
some trouble to avoid publicity.&nbsp; Nor were they gregarious
or luxurious in their tastes.&nbsp; A small, simple apartment was
usually more to their taste than a crowded salon, and they were
even prepared to pay a higher sum for it.</p>
<p>It was five minutes to four when Frank arrived, and the lady
had not yet appeared.&nbsp; He stood near the door and
waited.&nbsp; Presently a hansom rattled into the narrow street,
and there she sat framed in its concavity.&nbsp; A pretty woman
never looks prettier than in a hansom, with the shadows behind to
give their Rembrandt effect to the face in front.&nbsp; She
raised a yellow kid hand, and flashed a smile at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just the same as ever,&rsquo; said she, as he handed
her down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So are you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So glad you think so.&nbsp; I am afraid I can&rsquo;t
quite agree with you.&nbsp; Thirty-four yesterday.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s simply awful.&nbsp; Thank you, I have some
change.&nbsp; All right, cabby.&nbsp; Well, have you got a
room?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you&rsquo;ll come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, I should like to have a chat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clean-shaven, round-faced manager, a man of suave voice
and diplomatic manner, was standing in the passage.&nbsp; His
strange life was spent in standing in the passage.&nbsp; He
remembered the pair at once, and smiled paternally.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not seen you for some time, sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I have been engaged.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Married,&rsquo; said the lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said the proprietor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tea,
sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And muffins.&nbsp; You used to like the
muffins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, muffins by all means.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Number ten,&rsquo; said the proprietor, and a waiter
showed them upstairs.&nbsp; &lsquo;All meals nine shillings
each,&rsquo; he whispered, as Frank passed him at the door.&nbsp;
He was a new waiter, and so mistook every one for a new customer,
which is an error which runs through life.</p>
<p>It was a dingy little room with a round table covered by a
soiled cloth in the middle.&nbsp; Two windows, discreetly
blinded, let in a dim London light.&nbsp; An armchair stood at
each side of the empty fireplace, and an uncomfortable,
old-fashioned, horsehair sofa lined the opposite wall.&nbsp;
There were pink vases upon the mantelpiece, and a portrait of
Garibaldi above it.</p>
<p>The lady sat down and took off her gloves.&nbsp; Frank stood
by the window and smoked a cigarette.&nbsp; The waiter rattled
and banged and jingled with the final effect of producing a
tea-tray and a hot-water dish.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll ring if
you want me, sir,&rsquo; said he, and shut the door with
ostentatious completeness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now we can talk,&rsquo; said Frank, throwing his
cigarette into the fireplace.&nbsp; &lsquo;That waiter was
getting on my nerves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, I hope you&rsquo;re not angry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What at?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my saying I should come down to Woking, and all
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should have been angry if I thought you had meant
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I meant it right enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But with what object?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just to get level with you, Frankie, if you threw me
over too completely.&nbsp; Hang it all, she has three hundred and
sixty-five days in the year!&nbsp; Am I to be grudged a single
hour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Violet, we won&rsquo;t quarrel about it.&nbsp;
You see I came all right.&nbsp; Pull up your chair and have some
tea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t even looked at me yet.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t take any tea until you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stood up in front of him, and pushed up her veil.&nbsp; It
was a face and a figure worth looking at.&nbsp; Hazel eyes, dark
chestnut hair, a warm flush of pink in her cheeks, the features
and outline of an old Grecian goddess, but with more of Juno than
of Venus, for she might perhaps err a little upon the side of
opulence.&nbsp; There was a challenge and defiance dancing in
those dark devil-may-care eyes of hers which might have roused a
more cold-blooded man than her companion.&nbsp; Her dress was
simple and dark, but admirably cut.&nbsp; She was clever enough
to know that a pretty woman should concentrate attention upon
herself, and a plain one divert it to her adornments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove, Violet, you look splendid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The muffins are getting cold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frankie, what <i>is</i> the matter with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing is the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She put out her two hands and took hold of his.&nbsp; That
well-remembered sweet, subtle scent of hers rose to his
nostrils.&nbsp; There is nothing more insidious than a scent
which carries suggestions and associations.&nbsp; &lsquo;Frankie,
you have not kissed me yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned her smiling face upwards and sideways, and for an
instant he leaned forward towards it.&nbsp; But he had himself in
hand again in a moment.&nbsp; It gave him confidence to find how
quickly and completely he could do it.&nbsp; With a laugh, still
holding her two hands, he pushed her back into the chair by the
table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a good girl!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now we&rsquo;ll have some tea, and I&rsquo;ll give you a
small lecture while we do so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a nice one to give lectures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no such preacher as a converted
sinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You really are converted then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather.&nbsp; Two lumps, if I remember right.&nbsp; You
ought to do this, not I.&nbsp; No milk, and very strong&mdash;how
you keep your complexion I can&rsquo;t imagine.&nbsp; But you do
keep it; my word, you do!&nbsp; Now please don&rsquo;t look so
crossly at me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her flushed cheeks and resentful eyes had drawn forth the
remonstrance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You <i>are</i> changed,&rsquo; she said, with surprise
as well as anger in her voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, of course I am.&nbsp; I am married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For that matter Charlie Scott is married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t give Charlie Scott away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I give myself away.&nbsp; So you have lost all
your love for me.&nbsp; I thought it was to last for
ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, do be sensible, Violet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sensible!&nbsp; How I loathe that word!&nbsp; A man
only uses it when he is going to do something cold-blooded and
mean.&nbsp; It is always the beginning of the end.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you want me to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want you to be my own Frankie&mdash;just the same as
before.&nbsp; Ah do, Franck&mdash;don&rsquo;t leave me!&nbsp; You
know I would give any of them up for you.&nbsp; And you have a
good influence over me&mdash;you have really!&nbsp; You
call&rsquo;t think how hard I am with other people.&nbsp; Ask
Charlie Scott.&nbsp; He will tell you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been so
different since I have lost sight of you.&nbsp; Now, Frankie,
don&rsquo;t be horrid to me!&nbsp; Kiss and be nice!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Again her soft warm hand was upon his, and the faint sweet smell
of violets went to his blood like wine.&nbsp; He jumped up, lit
another cigarette, and paced about the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shan&rsquo;t have a cigarette, Frankie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because you said once it helped you to control
yourself.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want you to control yourself.&nbsp;
I want you to feel as I feel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do sit down, like a good girl!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cigarette out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd, Violet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, out with it, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, leave it alone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had snatched it from his lips and thrown it into the
grate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the use of that?&nbsp; I have a case
full.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They shall all follow the first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I won&rsquo;t smoke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see that you don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what the better are you for that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, be nice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go back to your chair and have some more
tea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, bother the tea!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t speak to you unless you sit down
and behave yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There now!&nbsp; Speak away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, dear Violet, you must not talk about this
any more.&nbsp; Some things are possible and some are
impossible.&nbsp; This is absolutely, finally impossible.&nbsp;
We can never go back upon the past.&nbsp; It is finished and done
with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what did you come here for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To bid you good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Platonic good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a private room at Mariani&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were always a little mad, Frankie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He leaned earnestly over the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, Violet, the chances are that we shall never
meet again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It takes two to say that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I mean that after to-day I should not meet you
again.&nbsp; If you were not quite what you are it would be
easier.&nbsp; But as it is I find it a little too much of a
test.&nbsp; No, don&rsquo;t mistake me or think that I am
weakening.&nbsp; That is impossible.&nbsp; But all the same I
don&rsquo;t want to go through it again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So sorry if I have upset you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He disregarded her irony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have been very good friends, Violet.&nbsp; Why
should we part as enemies?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should we part at all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We won&rsquo;t go back over that.&nbsp; Now do please
look facts in the face and help me to do the right thing, for it
would be so much easier if you would help me.&nbsp; If you were a
very good and kind girl you would shake my hand, like any other
old pal, and wish me joy of my marriage.&nbsp; You know that I
should do so if I knew that you were going to be
married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the lady was not to be so easily appeased.&nbsp; She took
her tea in silence or answered his remarks with monosyllables,
while the occasional flash of her dark eyes as she raised them
was like the distant lightning which heralds the storm.&nbsp;
Suddenly, with a swift rustle of skirts, she was between the door
and his chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Frankie, we have had about enough of this
nonsense,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t imagine that
you are going to get out of this thing so easily.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got you, and I&rsquo;ll keep you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He faced round in his chair and looked helplessly at her with
a hand upon each knee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Lord!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t begin it all over
again,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she answered with an angry
laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try another line this time, Master
Frank.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not the sort of woman who lets a thing go
easily when once I have set my heart upon it.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
try coaxing any longer&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So glad,&rsquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may say what you like, but you can&rsquo;t do it,
my boy.&nbsp; I knew you before she did, and I&rsquo;ll keep you,
or else I&rsquo;ll make such a row that you will be sorry that
you ever put my back up.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all very fine to sit
there and preach, but it won&rsquo;t do, Frankie.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t slip out of things as easily as all that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should you turn nasty like this, Violet?&nbsp; What
do you think you will gain by it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean to gain <i>you</i>.&nbsp; I like you,
Frankie.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure that I don&rsquo;t really love
you&mdash;real, real love, you know.&nbsp; Any way, I don&rsquo;t
intend to let you go, and if you go against my will I give you my
word that I shall make it pretty sultry for you down at
Woking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stared moodily into his teacup.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides, what rot it all is!&rsquo; she continued,
laying her hand upon his shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;When did you
begin to ride the high moral horse?&nbsp; You were just as
cheerful as the rest of them when last I saw you.&nbsp; You speak
as if a man ceased to live just because he is married.&nbsp; What
has changed you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what has changed me,&rsquo; said
he, looking up.&nbsp; &lsquo;My wife has changed me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, bother your wife!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A look which was new to her came over his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop that!&rsquo; said he sharply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no harm!&nbsp; How has your wife made this
wonderful change?&rsquo;</p>
<p>His mood softened as his thoughts flew back to Woking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By her own goodness&mdash;the atmosphere that she makes
round her.&nbsp; If you knew how wholesome she was, how delicate
in her most intimate thoughts, how fresh and how sweet and how
pure, you would understand that the thought of being false to her
is horrible.&nbsp; When I think of her as she sat at breakfast
this morning, so loving and so innocent&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He would have been more discreet if he had been less
eloquent.&nbsp; The lady&rsquo;s temper suddenly overflowed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Innocent!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;As innocent as
I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet with eyes which were more angry than her
own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold your tongue!&nbsp; How dare you talk against my
wife!&nbsp; You are not fit to mention her name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Woking,&rsquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can go to the devil!&rsquo; said he, and rang the
bell for his bill.&nbsp; She stared at him with a surprise which
had eclipsed her anger, while she pulled on her gloves with
little sharp twitches.&nbsp; This was a new Frank Crosse to
her.&nbsp; As long as a woman gets on very well with a man, she
is apt, at the back of her soul, to suspect him of
weakness.&nbsp; It is only when she differs from him that she can
see the other side, and it always comes as a surprise.&nbsp; She
liked him better than ever for the revelation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not joking,&rsquo; she whispered, as they
went down the stair.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go, as sure as
fate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took no notice, but passed on down the street without a
word of farewell.&nbsp; When he came to the turning he looked
back.&nbsp; She was standing by the curb, with her proud head
high in the air, while the manager screamed loudly upon a
whistle.&nbsp; A cab swung round a distant corner.&nbsp; Crosse
reached her before it did.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t hurt your feelings,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I spoke too roughly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trying to coax me away from Woking,&rsquo; she
sneered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m coming all the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s your affair,&rsquo; said he, as he handed
her into the cab.</p>

269</span>DANGER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Again</span> the bright little
dining-room, with the morning sun gleaming upon the high silver
coffee pot and the electro-plated toast-rack&mdash;everything the
same, down to the plates which Jemima had once again forgotten to
warm.&nbsp; Maude, with the golden light playing upon the fringes
of her curls, and throwing two little epaulettes of the daintiest
pink across her shoulders, sat in silence, glancing across from
time to time with interrogative eyes at her husband.&nbsp; He ate
his breakfast moodily, for he was very ill at ease.&nbsp; There
was a struggle within him, for his conscience was pulling him one
way and his instincts the other.&nbsp; Instincts are a fine old
conservative force, while conscience is a thing of yesterday, so
it is usually safe to prophesy which will sway the other.</p>
<p>The matter at issue was whether he should tell Maude about
Violet Wright.&nbsp; If she were going to carry out her threat,
then certainly it would be better to prepare her.&nbsp; But after
all, his arguments of yesterday might prevail with her when her
first impetuous fit of passion was over.&nbsp; Why should he go
half-way to meet danger?&nbsp; If it came, nothing which he could
say would ward it off.&nbsp; If it did not come, there was no
need for saying anything.&nbsp; Conscience told him that it would
be better to be perfectly straight with his wife.&nbsp; Instinct
told him that though she would probably be sweet and sympathetic
over it, yet it would rankle in her mind and poison her
thoughts.&nbsp; And perhaps for once, Instinct may have been
better than Conscience.&nbsp; Do not ask too many questions, you
young wife!&nbsp; Do not be too free with your reminiscences, you
young husband.&nbsp; There are things which can be forgiven, but
never, never, can they be forgotten.&nbsp; That highest thing on
earth, the heart of a loving woman, is too tender, too sacred, to
be bruised by a wanton confidence.&nbsp; You are hers.&nbsp; She
is yours.&nbsp; The future lies with both of you.&nbsp; It is
wiser to leave the past alone.&nbsp; The couples who boast that
they have never had a secret are sometimes happy because the
boast is sometimes untrue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t be late to-day, Frank,&rsquo; said
Maude at last, peeping round the tall coffee-pot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, dear, I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were yesterday, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I know I was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you kept at the office?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I had tea with a friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At his house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, at a restaurant.&nbsp; Where has Jemima put my
boots?&nbsp; I wonder if she has cleaned them.&nbsp; I can never
tell by looking.&nbsp; Here they are.&nbsp; And my coat?&nbsp;
Anything I can get you in town?&nbsp; Well, good-bye, dear,
good-bye!&rsquo;&nbsp; Maude had never seen him make so hurried
an exit.</p>
<p>It is always a mystery to the City man how his wife puts in
the seven hours a day of loneliness while the E.C. has claimed
him for its own.&nbsp; She cannot explain it to him, for she can
hardly explain it to herself.&nbsp; It is frittered away in a
thousand little tasks, each trivial in itself, and yet making in
their sum the difference between a well-ordered and a neglected
household.&nbsp; Under the illustrious guidance of the omniscient
Mrs. Beeton there is the usual routine to be gone through.&nbsp;
The cook has to be seen, the larder examined, the remains
cunningly transformed into new and attractive shapes, the dinner
to be ordered (anything will do for lunch), and the new supplies
to be got in.&nbsp; The husband accepts the excellent little
dinner, the fried sole, the <i>ris de veau en caisse</i>, the
lemon pudding, as if they had grown automatically out of the
table-cloth.&nbsp; He knows nothing of the care, the judgment,
the prevision which ring the changes with every season, which
never relax and never mistake.&nbsp; He enjoys the fruits, but he
ignores the work which raised them.&nbsp; And yet the work goes
cheerfully and uncomplainingly on.</p>
<p>Then when every preparation has been made for the
dinner&mdash;that solemn climax of the British day, there is
plenty for Maude to do.&nbsp; There is the white chiffon to be
taken out of the neck of that dress, and the pink to be put
in.&nbsp; Amateur dressmaking is always going on at The Lindens,
and Frank has become more careful in his caresses since he found
one evening that his wife had a row of pins between her
lips&mdash;which is not a pleasant discovery to make with your
own.&nbsp; Then there are drawers to be tidied, and silver to be
cleaned, and the leaves of the gutta-percha plant to be washed,
and the feather which was damped yesterday to be re-curled before
the fire.&nbsp; That leaves just time before lunch to begin the
new novel by glancing at the last two pages to see what
<i>did</i> happen, and then the three minutes lunch of a lonely
woman.&nbsp; So much for business, now for the more trying social
duties.&nbsp; The pink dressing-gown is shed and a trim little
walking dress&mdash;French grey cloth with white lisse in front
and a grey zouave jacket&mdash;takes its place.&nbsp; Visiting
strangers is not nearly so hard when you are pleased with your
dress, and even entertaining becomes more easy when your
costumi&egrave;re lives in Regent Street.&nbsp; On Tuesdays Maude
is at home.&nbsp; Every other day she hunts through her plate of
cards, and is overwhelmed by the sense of her rudeness towards
her neighbours.&nbsp; But her task is never finished, though day
after day she comes back jaded with her exertions.&nbsp;
Strangers still call upon her&mdash;&lsquo;hope it is not too
late to do the right thing, and to welcome,&rsquo; etc.,
etc.&mdash;and they have to be re-visited.&nbsp; While she is
visiting them, other cards appear upon her hall table, and so the
foolish and tiresome convention continues to exhaust the time and
the energies of its victim.</p>
<p>Those original receptions were really very difficult.&nbsp;
Jemima announced a name which might or might not bear some
relation to the visitor&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The lady entered.&nbsp;
Her name might perhaps be Mrs. Baker.&nbsp; Maude had no means of
knowing who Mrs. Baker might be.&nbsp; The visitor seldom
descended to an explanation.&nbsp; Ten minutes of desultory and
forced conversation about pinewoods and golf and cremation.&nbsp;
A cup of tea and a departure.&nbsp; Then Maude would rush to the
card-tray to try to find out whom it was that she had been
talking to, and what it was all about.</p>
<p>Maude did not intend to go visiting that particular day, and
she had hoped that no one might visit her.&nbsp; The hours of
danger were almost past, and it was close upon four
o&rsquo;clock, when there came a brisk pull at the bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. White,&rsquo; said Jemima, opening the
drawing-room door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wright,&rsquo; said the visitor, as she walked
in&mdash;&lsquo;Mrs. Violet Wright.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude rose with her pleasant smile.&nbsp; It was a peculiarly
sweet and kindly smile, for it was inspired by a gentle womanly
desire to make things pleasant for all who were around her.&nbsp;
Amiability was never artificial with her, for she had the true
instincts of a lady&mdash;those instincts so often spoken of, so
seldom, so very seldom seen.&nbsp; Like a gentleman, or a
Christian, or any other ideal, it is but a poor approximation
which is commonly attained.</p>
<p>But the visitor did not respond to the pretty gesture of
welcome, nor did her handsome face return that sympathetic
smile.&nbsp; They stood for an instant looking at each other, the
one tall, masterful, mature, the other sweet, girlish, and
self-distrustful, but each beautiful and engaging in her own
way.&nbsp; Lucky Master Frank, whose past and present could take
such a form; but luckier still if he could have closed the past
when the present opened.&nbsp; The visitor was silent, but her
dark eyes looked critically and fixedly at her rival.&nbsp;
Maude, setting the silence down to the shyness of a first visit,
tried to make matters easier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please try this armchair.&nbsp; No doubt you have had a
tiring walk.&nbsp; It is still very warm in the afternoons.&nbsp;
I think it was so kind of you to call.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A faint smile flickered upon the dark face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kind of me to call!&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; for in a rising place like Woking, with so many
new arrivals, it must be quite a task for the older inhabitants
to welcome them.&nbsp; I have been so surprised by the kindness
which every one has shown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I see,&rsquo; said her visitor, &lsquo;you think
that I live here.&nbsp; I have really just come down from
London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Maude, and awaited an
explanation.&nbsp; As none was forthcoming, she added, &lsquo;You
will find Woking a very nice place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A nice place to be buried in, alive or dead,&rsquo;
said her visitor.</p>
<p>There was something peculiarly ungracious in her tone and
manner.&nbsp; It seemed to Maude that she had never before been
alone with so singular a person.&nbsp; There was, in the first
place, her striking and yet rather sinister and voluptuous
beauty.</p>
<p>Then there was the absolute carelessness of her manner, the
quiet assumption that she was outside the usual conventionalities
of life.&nbsp; It is a manner only to be met in English life,
among some of the highest of the high world, and some of the
highest of the half world.&nbsp; It was new to Maude, and it made
her uncomfortable, while mingled with it there was something else
which made her feel for the first time in her life that she had
incurred the hostility of a fellow-mortal.&nbsp; It chilled her,
and made her unhappy.</p>
<p>The visitor made no effort to sustain the conversation, but
leaned back in her chair and stared at her hostess with a very
critical and searching glance.&nbsp; Those two questioning dark
eyes played eagerly over her from her brown curls down to the
little shining shoe-tips which peeped from under the grey
skirt.&nbsp; Especially they dwelt upon her face, reading it and
rereading it.&nbsp; Never had Maude been so inspected, and her
instinct told her that the inspection was not altogether a
friendly one.</p>
<p>Violet Wright having examined her rival, proceeded now with
the same cool attention to take in her surroundings.&nbsp; She
looked round deliberately at the furniture of the room, and
reconstructed in her own mind the life of the people who owned
it.&nbsp; Maude ventured upon one or two conventional remarks,
but her visitor was not to be diverted to the weather or to the
slowness of the South-Western train service.&nbsp; She continued
her quiet and silent inspection.&nbsp; Suddenly she rose and
swept across to the side-table.&nbsp; A photograph of Frank in
his volunteer uniform stood upon it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is your husband, Mr. Frank Crosse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, do you know him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Slightly.&nbsp; We have mutual friends.&rsquo;&nbsp; An
ambiguous smile played across her face as she spoke.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This must have been taken after I saw him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was taken just after our marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite so.&nbsp; He looks like a good little married
man.&nbsp; The photograph is flattering.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you think so!&rsquo; said Maude coldly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My own impression is that it fails to do him
justice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her visitor laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course that <i>would</i>
be your impression,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>Maude&rsquo;s gentle soul began to rise in anger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the truth,&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is right that you should think so,&rsquo; the other
answered, with the same irritating laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must have known him very slightly if you
can&rsquo;t see that it is the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I must have known him very slightly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude was very angry indeed.&nbsp; She began to find sides to
her own nature the very existence of which she had never
suspected.&nbsp; She tapped her little shoe upon the ground, and
she sat with a pale face, and compressed lips, and bright eyes,
quite prepared to be very rude indeed to this eccentric woman who
ventured to criticise her Frank in so free and easy a
style.&nbsp; Her visitor watched her, and a change had come over
her expression.&nbsp; Maude&rsquo;s evident anger seemed to amuse
and interest her.&nbsp; Her eyes lost their critical coldness,
and softened into approval.&nbsp; She suddenly put her hand upon
the other&rsquo;s shoulder with so natural and yet masterful a
gesture, that Maude found it impossible to resent it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a lucky man to have such a warm little
champion,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>Her strong character and greater knowledge of the world gave
her an ascendency over the girlish wife such as age has over
youth.&nbsp; There were not ten years between them, and yet Maude
felt that for some reason the conversation between them could not
quite be upon equal terms.&nbsp; The quiet assurance of her
visitor, whatever its cause, made resentment or remonstrance
difficult.&nbsp; Besides, they were a pair of very kindly as well
as of very shrewd eyes which now looked down into hers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You love him very much, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I love him.&nbsp; He is my
husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does it always follow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are married yourself.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you love
yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, never mind mine.&nbsp; <i>He&rsquo;s</i> all
right.&nbsp; Did you ever love any one else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not really.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude was astonished at herself, and yet the questions were so
frankly put that a frank answer came naturally to them.&nbsp; It
pleased her to lose that cold chill of dislike, and to feel that
for some reason her strange visitor had become more friendly to
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You lucky girl, you actually married the one love of
your life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a splendid thing to do!&nbsp; I thought it only
happened in books.&nbsp; How happy you must be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I <i>am</i> very, very happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I dare say you deserve to be.&nbsp; Besides, you
really are very pretty.&nbsp; If ever you had a rival, I should
think that it must be some consolation to her to know that it was
so charming a person who cut her out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude laughed at the thought.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never had a rival,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
husband never <i>really</i> loved until he met me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he&mdash;oh yes, quite so!&nbsp; That is so nice
that you should both start with a clean sheet!&nbsp; I thought
you were very handsome just now when you were angry with me, but
you are quite delightful with that little flush upon your
cheeks.&nbsp; If I had been a man, your husband would certainly
have had one rival in his wooing.&nbsp; And so he really never
loved any one but you?&nbsp; I thought that also only happened in
books.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a hard and ironic tone in the last sentences which
jarred upon Maude&rsquo;s sensitive nature.&nbsp; She glanced up
quickly and was surprised at the look of pain which had come upon
her companion&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; It relaxed into a serious
serenity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That fits in beautifully,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But there&rsquo;s one bit of advice which I should like to
give you, if you won&rsquo;t think it a liberty.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be selfish in your married life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Selfish!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, there is a kind of family selfishness which is
every bit as bad&mdash;I am not sure that it is not
worse&mdash;than personal selfishness.&nbsp; People love each
other, and they shut out the world, and have no thought for any
one else, and the whole universe can slide to perdition so long
as their love is not disturbed.&nbsp; That is what I call family
selfishness.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a sin and a shame.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude looked at this strange woman in amazement.&nbsp; She was
speaking fast and hotly, like one whose bitter thoughts have been
long penned up for want of a suitable listener.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Remember the women who have been less fortunate than
you.&nbsp; Remember the thousands who are starving, dying, for
want of love, and no love comes their way; whose hearts yearn and
faint for that which Nature owes them, but Nature never pays her
debt.&nbsp; Remember the plain women.&nbsp; Remember the lonely
women.&nbsp; Above all, remember your unfortunate sisters; they,
the most womanly of all, who have been ruined by their own
kindliness and trust and loving weakness.&nbsp; It is that family
selfishness which turns every house in the land into a fort to be
held against these poor wanderers.&nbsp; They make them evil, and
then they revile the very evil which they have made.&nbsp; When I
look back&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stopped with a sudden sob.&nbsp; Her forearm fell upon the
mantelpiece, and her forehead upon her forearm.&nbsp; In an
instant Maude was by her side, the tears running down her cheeks,
for the sight of grief was always grief to her, and her nerves
were weakened by this singular interview.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Mrs. Wright, don&rsquo;t cry!&rsquo; she
whispered, and her little white hand passed in a soothing,
hesitating gesture over the coil of rich chestnut hair.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cry!&nbsp; I am afraid you have
suffered.&nbsp; Oh, how I wish I could help you!&nbsp; Do tell me
how I can help you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Violet&rsquo;s occasional fits of weakness were never of a
very long duration.&nbsp; She dashed her hand impatiently across
her eyes, straightened her tall figure, and laughed as she
glanced at herself in the mirror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madame Celandine would be surprised if she could see
how I have treated one of her masterpieces,&rsquo; said she, as
she straightened her crushed hat, and arranged her hair with
those quick little deft pats of the palm with which women can
accomplish so much in so short a time.&nbsp; Rumpled finery sets
the hands of every woman within sight of it fidgeting, so Maude
joined in at the patting and curling and forgot all about her
tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, that will have to do,&rsquo; said Violet at
last.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am so sorry to have made such a fool of
myself.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t err upon the sentimental side as a
rule.&nbsp; I suppose it is about time that I thought of catching
my train for town.&nbsp; I have a theatre engagement which I must
not miss.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How strange it is!&rsquo; said Maude, looking at her
own pretty tear-marked face in the mirror.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
only been here a few minutes, as time goes, and yet I feel that
in some things I am more intimate with you than with any woman I
have ever met.&nbsp; How can it be?&nbsp; What bond can there be
to draw us together like this?&nbsp; And it is the more
extraordinary, because I felt that you disliked me when you
entered the room, and I am sure that you won&rsquo;t be offended
if I say that when you had been here a little I thought that I
disliked you.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; On the contrary, I
wish you could come every day.&nbsp; And I want to come and see
you also when I am in town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude, for all her amiability, was not gushing by nature, and
this long speech caused her great astonishment when she looked
back upon it.&nbsp; But at the moment it came so naturally from
her heart that she never paused to think of its oddity.&nbsp; Her
enthusiasm was a little chilled, however, by the way in which her
advances were received.&nbsp; Violet Wright&rsquo;s eyes were
more kindly than ever, but she shook her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose we shall ever meet
again.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I could ask you to visit me in
London.&nbsp; I wanted to see you, and I have seen you, but that,
I fear, must be the end of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude&rsquo;s lip trembled in a way which it had when she was
hurt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you wish to see me, then?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On account of that slight acquaintance with your
husband.&nbsp; I thought it would be interesting to see what sort
of wife he had chosen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you are not disappointed,&rsquo; said Maude,
making a roguish face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has done very well&mdash;better than I
expected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had not much respect for his taste,
then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, I always thought highly of his
taste.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have such a pretty way of putting things.&nbsp; You
know my husband very slightly, but still I can see that you know
the world very well.&nbsp; I often wonder if I am really the best
kind of woman that he could have married.&nbsp; Do you think I
am, Mrs. Wright?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her visitor looked in silence for a little at the gentle grace
and dainty sympathetic charm of the woman before her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said slowly, as one who weighs her
words.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think you are.&nbsp; You are a lady with a
lady&rsquo;s soul in you.&nbsp; A woman can draw a man down very
low, or she can make him live at his very highest.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be soft with him.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t give way when you
know that your way is the higher way.&nbsp; Pull him up,
don&rsquo;t let him ever pull you down.&nbsp; Then his respect
for you will strengthen his love for you, and the two together
are so much greater than either one apart.&nbsp; Your instinct
would be to do this, and therefore you are the best sort of woman
for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her opinion was given with so much thought, and yet so much
decision, that Maude glowed with pride and with pleasure.&nbsp;
There was knowledge and authority behind the words of this
unaccountable woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How sweet you are!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
feel that what you say is true.&nbsp; I feel that that is what a
wife should be to her husband.&nbsp; Please God, I will be so to
Frank!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And one other piece of advice before I leave
you,&rsquo; said Violet Wright.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ever
take your husband for granted.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ever accept his
kiss or caress as a routine thing.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ever relax
those little attentions which you showed him in the earliest
days.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let the freshness go out of love, for the
love may soon follow it, even when duty keeps the man true.&nbsp;
It is the commonest mistake which married women make.&nbsp; It
has caused more unhappiness than any other.&nbsp; They do not
realise it until it is too late.&nbsp; Be keenly watchful for
your husband&rsquo;s wants and comforts.&nbsp; It is not the
comfort but the attention which he values.&nbsp; If it is not
there he will say nothing, if he is a good fellow, but he notices
it all the same.&nbsp; She has changed, he thinks.&nbsp; And from
that moment he will begin to change also.&nbsp; Be on your guard
against that.&nbsp; It is very unselfish of me to give you all
this wise counsel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very good of you, and I feel that it is all so
true.&nbsp; But why is it unselfish of you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I only meant that I had no interest in the
matter.&nbsp; What does it matter to me whether you keep his love
or not.&nbsp; And yet I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
suddenly put her arms round Maude, and kissed her upon the
cheek.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are a good little sort, and I hope you
will be happy.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Frank Crosse had disentangled himself from the rush of City
men emerging from the Woking station, and he was walking swiftly
through the gathering gloom along the vile, deeply-rutted road,
which formed a short cut to The Lindens.&nbsp; Suddenly, with a
sinking heart, he was aware of a tall graceful figure which was
sweeping towards him.&nbsp; There could not be two women of that
height, who carried themselves in that fashion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Violet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hullo, Frankie!&nbsp; I thought it might be you, but
those tall hats and black overcoats make every one alike.&nbsp;
Your wife will be glad to see you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Violet!&nbsp; You have ruined our happiness.&nbsp; How
could you have the heart to do it!&nbsp; It is not for myself I
speak, God knows.&nbsp; But to think of her feelings being so
abused, her confidence so shaken&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, Frankie, there is nothing to be tragic
about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you been to my house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And seen her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well then&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t give you away, my boy.&nbsp; I was a
model of discretion.&nbsp; I give you my word that it is all
right.&nbsp; And she&rsquo;s a dear little soul, Frankie.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re not worthy to varnish those pretty patent leathers
of hers.&nbsp; You know you&rsquo;re not.&nbsp; And by Jove,
Frankie, if you had stayed with me yesterday I should never have
forgiven you&mdash;no, never!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll resign in her
favour.&nbsp; I will.&nbsp; But in no one else&rsquo;s, and if
ever I hear of your going wrong, my boy, or doing anything but
the best with that sweet trusting woman, I&rsquo;ll make you
curse the day that ever you knew me&mdash;I will, by the living
Jingo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do, Violet&mdash;you have my leave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right.&nbsp; The least said the soonest
mended.&nbsp; Give me a kiss before we part.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She raised her veil, and he kissed her.&nbsp; He was wearing
some withered flower in his overcoat, and she took it from
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a souvenir of our friendship, Frankie, and
rather a good emblem of it also.&nbsp; So-long!&rsquo; said she,
as she turned down the weary road which leads to the
station.&nbsp; A young golfer, getting in at Byfleet, was
surprised to see a handsome woman weeping bitterly in the corner
of a second-class carriage.&nbsp; &lsquo;Comm&rsquo; up from
roastin&rsquo; somebody at that damned crematory place,&rsquo;
was his explanation to his companion.</p>
<p>Frank had a long and animated account from Maude of the
extraordinary visitor whom she had entertained.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s such a pity, dear, that you don&rsquo;t know
her well, for I should really like to hear every detail about
her.&nbsp; At first I thought she was mad, and then I thought she
was odious, and then finally she seemed to be the very wisest and
kindest woman that I had ever known.&nbsp; She made me angry, and
frightened, and grieved, and grateful, and affectionate, one
after the other, and I never in my life was so taken out of
myself by any one.&nbsp; She <i>is</i> so sensible!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sensible, is she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she said that I was&mdash;oh!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
repeat it&mdash;everything that is nice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then she <i>is</i> sensible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And such a high opinion of your taste.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had she indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know, Frank, I really believe that in a quiet,
secret, retiring sort of way she has been fond of you
herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Maude, what funny ideas you get sometimes!&nbsp; I
say, if we are going out for dinner, it is high time that we
began to dress.&rsquo;</p>

of Carlyle</i>, and Maude had been dipping into it in the few
spare half-hours which the many duties of a young housekeeper
left her.&nbsp; At first it struck her as dry, but from the
moment that she understood that this was, among other things, an
account of the inner life of a husband and a wife, she became
keenly interested, and a passionate and unreasonable
partisan.&nbsp; For Frederick and Cromwell and the other great
issues her feelings were tolerant but lukewarm.&nbsp; But the
great sex-questions of &lsquo;How did he treat her?&rsquo; and of
&lsquo;How did she stand it?&rsquo; filled her with that eternal
and personal interest with which they affect every woman.&nbsp;
Her gentle nature seldom disliked any one, but certainly amongst
those whom she liked least, the gaunt figure of the Chelsea sage
began to bulk largely.&nbsp; One night, as Frank sat reading in
front of the fire, he suddenly found his wife on her knees upon
the rug, and a pair of beseeching eyes upon his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frank, dear, I want you to make me a
promise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you grant it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I tell you when I have not heard it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How horrid you are, Frank!&nbsp; A year ago you would
have promised first and asked afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I am a shrewd old married man now.&nbsp; Well, let
me hear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want you to promise me that you will never be a
Carlyle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really and truly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You swear it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Frank, you can&rsquo;t think what a relief that is to
me.&nbsp; That dear, good, helpful, little lady&mdash;it really
made me cry this morning when I thought how she had been
used.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been reading that green-covered book of yours,
and he seemed so cold and so sarcastic and so
unsympathetic.&nbsp; He never seemed to appreciate all that she
did for him.&nbsp; He had no thought for her.&nbsp; He lived in
his books and never in her&mdash;such a harsh, cruel
man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank went upstairs, and returned with a volume in his
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you have finished the &lsquo;Life,&rsquo; you must
read this, dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is her letters.&nbsp; They were arranged for
publication after her death, while her husband was still
alive.&nbsp; You know that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please take it for granted, darling, that I know
nothing.&nbsp; It is so jolly to have some one before whom it is
not necessary to keep up appearances.&nbsp; Now, begin at the
beginning and go ahead.&rsquo;&nbsp; She pillowed her head
luxuriously against his knees.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to tell&mdash;or very
little.&nbsp; As you say, they had their troubles in life.&nbsp;
The lady could take particularly good care of herself, I
believe.&nbsp; She had a tongue like a lancet when she chose to
use it.&nbsp; He, poor chap, was all liver and nerves,
porridge-poisoned in his youth.&nbsp; No children to take the
angles off them.&nbsp; Half a dozen little buffer states would
have kept them at peace.&nbsp; However, to hark back to what I
was about to say, he outlived her by fifteen years or so.&nbsp;
During that time he collected these letters, and he has annotated
them.&nbsp; You can read those notes here, and the man who wrote
those notes loved his wife and cherished her memory, if ever a
man did upon earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The graceful head beside his knee shook impatiently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the use of that to the poor dead woman?&nbsp;
Why could not he show his love by kindness and thought for her
while she was alive?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you, Maude, there were two sides to that.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be so prejudiced!&nbsp; And remember that no one has
ever blamed Carlyle as bitterly as he has blamed himself.&nbsp; I
could read you bits of these notes&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the first letter, in which she is talking
about how they first moved into the house at Cheyne Row.&nbsp;
They spent their early years in Scotland, you know, and he was a
man going on to the forties when he came to London.&nbsp; The
success of <i>Sartor Resartus</i> encouraged them to the
step.&nbsp; Her letter describes all the incoming.&nbsp; Here is
his comment, written after her death: &ldquo;In about a week all
was swept and garnished, fairly habitable; and continued
incessantly to get itself polished, civilised, and beautified to
a degree that surprised one.&nbsp; I have elsewhere alluded to
all that, and to my little Jeannie&rsquo;s conduct of it; heroic,
lovely, pathetic, mournfully beautiful as in the light of
Eternity that little scene of time now looks to me.&nbsp; From
birth upwards she had lived in opulence, and now became poor for
me&mdash;so nobly poor.&nbsp; No such house for beautiful thrift,
quiet, spontaneous, nay, as it were, unconscious minimum of money
reconciled to human comfort and human dignity, have I anywhere
looked upon where I have been.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, Maude, did that
man appreciate his wife?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the obstinate head still shook.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Words, words,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but words with the ring of truth in them.&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t you tell real feeling from sham?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe women can, or they would not be so often taken in.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s the heading of the next letter: &ldquo;Mournfully
beautiful is this letter to me, a clear little household light
shining pure and brilliant in the dark obstructive places of the
past&rdquo;&mdash;a little later comes the note: &ldquo;Oh my
poor little woman&mdash;become poor for me.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like to hear him talk like that.&nbsp; Yes, I do like
him better after what you have said, Frank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must remember two things about him, Maude.&nbsp;
The first, that he was a Scotchman, who are of all men the least
likely to wear their hearts upon their sleeves; the other, that
his mind was always grappling with some far-away subject which
made him forget the smaller things close by him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the smaller things are everything to a
woman,&rsquo; said Maude.&nbsp; &lsquo;If ever you forget those
smaller things, sir, to be as courteous to your wife as you would
be to any other lady, to be loving and thoughtful and
sympathetic, it will be no consolation to me to know that you
have written the grandest book that ever was.&nbsp; I should just
hate that book, and I believe that in her inmost heart this poor
lady hated all the books that had taken her husband away from
her.&nbsp; I wonder if their house is still standing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly it is.&nbsp; Would you like to visit
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is anything I should like
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Maude, we are getting quite a distinguished circle
of acquaintances.&nbsp; Mr. Pepys last month&mdash;and now the
Carlyles.&nbsp; Well, we could not spend a Saturday afternoon
better, so if you will meet me to-morrow at Charing Cross, we
shall have a cosy little lunch together at Gatti&rsquo;s, and
then go down to Chelsea.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Maude was a rigid economist, and so was Frank in his way, for
with the grand self-respect of the middle classes the thought of
debt was unendurable to them.&nbsp; A cab in preference to a
&rsquo;bus gave both of them a feeling of dissipation, but none
the less they treated themselves to one on the occasion of this,
their little holiday.&nbsp; It is a delightful thing to snuggle
up in, is a hansom; but in order to be really trim and
comfortable one has to put one&rsquo;s arm round one&rsquo;s
companion&rsquo;s waist.&nbsp; No one can observe it there, for
the vehicle is built upon intelligent principles.&nbsp; The
cabman, it is true, can overlook you through a hole in the
roof.&nbsp; This cabman did so, and chuckled in his cravat.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If that cove&rsquo;s wife could see him&mdash;huddup,
then!&rsquo; said the cabman.</p>
<p>He was an intelligent cabman too, for having heard Frank say
&lsquo;Thomas Carlyle&rsquo;s house&rsquo; after giving the
address 5 Cheyne Row, he pulled up on the Thames
Embankment.&nbsp; Right ahead of them was Chelsea Bridge, seen
through a dim, soft London haze&mdash;monstrous, Cyclopean, giant
arches springing over a vague river of molten metal, the whole
daintily blurred, as though out of focus.&nbsp; The glamour of
the London haze, what is there upon earth so beautiful?&nbsp; But
it was not to admire it that the cabman had halted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardin&rsquo;, sir,&rsquo; said he, in the
softly insinuating way of the Cockney, &lsquo;but I thought that
maybe the lidy would like to see Mr. Carlyle&rsquo;s
statue.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s &rsquo;im, sir, a-sittin&rsquo; in the
overcoat with the book in &rsquo;is &rsquo;and.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank and Maude got out and entered the small railed garden,
in the centre of which the pedestal rose.&nbsp; It was very
simple and plain&mdash;an old man in a dressing-gown, with homely
wornout boots, a book upon his knee, his eyes and thoughts far
away.&nbsp; No more simple statue in all London, but human to a
surprising degree.&nbsp; They stood for five minutes and stared
at it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Frank at last, &lsquo;small as it is,
I think it is worthy of the man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is so natural.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can see him think.&nbsp; By Jove, it is
splendid!&rsquo;&nbsp; Frank had enough of the true artist to be
able to feel that rush of enthusiasm which adequate work should
cause.&nbsp; That old man, with his head shamefully defiled by
birds, was a positive joy to him.&nbsp; Among the soulless,
pompous, unspeakable London statues, here at last there was one
over which it is pleasant to linger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What other one is there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gordon in Trafalgar Square.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Gordon, perhaps.&nbsp; But our Nelsons and
Napiers and Havelocks&mdash;to think that we could do no better
than that for them!&nbsp; Now, dear, we have seen the
man&mdash;let us look at the house!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It had evidently been an old-fashioned building when first
they came to it.&nbsp; 1708 was the date at the corner of the
street.&nbsp; Six or seven drab-coloured, flat-chested,
dim-windowed houses stood in a line&mdash;theirs wedged in the
middle of them.&nbsp; A poor medallion with a profile head of him
had been clumsily let into the wall.&nbsp; Several worn steps led
to the thin high door with an old-fashioned fanlight above
it.&nbsp; Frank rang the bell, and a buxom cheerful matron came
at the call.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Names in this book, sir&mdash;<i>and</i> address, if
you please,&rsquo; said the cheery matron.&nbsp; &lsquo;One
shilling each&mdash;thank you, sir.&nbsp; First door to the left,
sir!&nbsp; This was the dining-room, sir&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Frank had come to a dead stop in the dim, dull,
wood-panelled hall.&nbsp; In front of them rose the stairs with
old-fashioned banisters, cracked, warped, and dusty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s awful to think of, Maude&mdash;awful!&nbsp;
To think that she ran up those stairs as a youngish
woman&mdash;that he took them two at a time as an active man, and
then that they hobbled and limped down them, old and weary and
broken, and now both dead and gone for ever, and the stairs
standing, the very rails, the very treads&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know that I ever felt so strongly what bubbles of the air we are,
so fragile, so utterly dissolved when the prick comes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How <i>could</i> they be happy in such a house?&rsquo;
said Maude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can feel that there have been sorrow
and trouble here.&nbsp; There is an atmosphere of
gloom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The matron-attendant approved of emotion, but in its due
order.&nbsp; One should be affected in the dining-room first, and
then in the hall.&nbsp; And so at her summons they followed her
into the long, low, quaint room in which this curious couple had
lived their everyday life.&nbsp; Little of the furniture was
left, and the walls were lined with collected pictures bearing
upon the life of the Carlyles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the fireplace that he smoked his pipe
up,&rsquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why up the fireplace?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She did not like the smell in the room.&nbsp; He often
at night took his friends down into the kitchen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fancy my driving you into the kitchen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the habit of smoking was looked upon much less
charitably at that time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And besides, he smoked clay pipes,&rsquo; said the
matron.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is considered a good print of Mrs.
Carlyle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a peaky eager face, with a great spirit looking out of
it, and possibilities of passion both for good and evil in the
keen, alert features.&nbsp; Just beside her was the dour, grim
outline of her husband.&nbsp; Their life-histories were in those
two portraits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor dear!&rsquo; said Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, you may say so,&rsquo; said the matron, whose
accent showed that she was from the north of the Tweed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He was gey ill to live wi&rsquo;.&nbsp; His own mither
said so.&nbsp; Now, what think you that room was for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was little larger than a cupboard, without window or
skylight, opening out of the end of the dining-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, it was the powdering-room in the days when
folk wore wigs.&nbsp; The powder made such a mess that they just
had a room for nothing else.&nbsp; There was a hole in the door,
and the man put his head through the hole, and the barber on the
other side powdered him out of the flour-dredger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was curious to be brought back in this fashion to those
far-off days, and to suddenly realise how many other people had
played their tragi-comedies within these walls.&nbsp; Wigs!&nbsp;
Only the dressy people wore wigs.&nbsp; So people of fashion in
the days of the early Georges trod these same rooms where Carlyle
grumbled and his wife fretted.&nbsp; And they too had grumbled
and fretted&mdash;or worse perhaps.&nbsp; It was a ghostly old
house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This,&rsquo; said the matron, when they had passed up
the stair, &lsquo;used to be the drawing-room.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
their sofa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not <i>the</i> sofa,&rsquo; said Frank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, the sofa that is mentioned in the
letters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was so proud of it, Maude.&nbsp; Gave eighteen
shillings for it, and covered and stuffed it herself.&nbsp; And
that, I suppose, is <i>the</i> screen.&nbsp; She was a great
housekeeper&mdash;brought up a spoiled child, according to her
own account, but a great housekeeper all the same.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s that writing in the case?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the history that he was at work on when he
died&mdash;something about the kings of Norway, sir.&nbsp; Those
are his corrections in blue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t read them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more could any one else, sir.&nbsp; Perhaps
that&rsquo;s why the book has never been published.&nbsp; Those
are the portraits of the kings of Prussia, about whom he wrote a
book.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank looked with interest at the old engravings, one of the
schoolmaster face of the great Frederick, the other of the
frog-like features of Frederick William, the half-mad recruiter
of the big Potsdam grenadiers.&nbsp; When he had finished, the
matron had gone down to open the door, and they were alone.&nbsp;
Maude&rsquo;s hand grasped his.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it not strange, dear?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here they lived, the most talented couple in the world,
and yet with all their wisdom they missed what we have
got&mdash;what perhaps that good woman who showed us round has
got&mdash;the only thing, as it seems to me, that is really worth
living for.&nbsp; What are all the wit and all the learning and
all the insight into things compared to love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove, little woman, in all this house of wise
sayings, no wiser or deeper saying has been said than that.&nbsp;
Well, thank God, we have that anyhow!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he kissed
his wife, while six grand electors of Brandenburg and kings of
Prussia looked fiercely out upon them from the wall.</p>
<p>They sat down together in two old chairs in the window, and
they looked out into the dingy street, and Frank tried to recount
all the great men&mdash;&lsquo;the other great men, as Maude
said, half chaffing and half earnest&mdash;who had looked through
those panes.&nbsp; Tennyson, Ruskin, Emerson, Mill, Froude,
Mazzini, Leigh Hunt&mdash;he had got so far when the matron
returned.</p>
<p>There was a case in the corner with some of the wreckage from
those vanished vessels.&nbsp; Notes from old Goethe in a
singularly neat boyish writing inscribed upon little ornamented
cards.&nbsp; Here, too, were small inscriptions which had lain
upon presents from Carlyle to his wife.&nbsp; It was pleasant
among all that jangling of the past to think of the love which
had written them, and that other love which had so carefully
preserved them.&nbsp; On one was written: &lsquo;All good attend
my darling through this gulf of time and through the long ocean
it is leading to.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; T.
C.&rsquo;&nbsp; On another, dated 1850, and attached evidently to
some birthday present, was: &lsquo;Many years to my poor little
Jeannie, and may the worst of them be past.&nbsp; No good that is
in me to give her shall ever be wanting while I live.&nbsp; May
God bless her.&rsquo;&nbsp; How strange that this apostle of
reticence should have such privacies as these laid open before
the curious public within so few years of his death!</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is her bedroom,&rsquo; said the matron.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And here is the old red bed,&rsquo; cried Frank.&nbsp;
It looked bare and gaunt and dreary with its uncurtained
posts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bed belonged to Mrs. Carlyle&rsquo;s mother,&rsquo;
the matron explained.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the same bed that
Mrs. Carlyle talks about in her letters when she says how she
pulled it to pieces.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did she pull it to pieces?&rsquo; asked Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better not inquire, dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed you&rsquo;re right, sir.&nbsp; If you get them
into these old houses, it is very hard to get them out.&nbsp; A
cleaner woman than Mrs. Carlyle never came out of Scotland.&nbsp;
This little room behind was his dressing-room.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s his stick in the corner.&nbsp; Look what&rsquo;s
written upon the window!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly it was a ghostly house.&nbsp; Scratched upon one of
the panes with a diamond was the following piece of
information&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;John Harbel Knowles cleaned all the windows
in this house, and painted part, in the eighteenth year of
age.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>March</i> 7<i>th</i>,
1794.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Who was <i>he</i>?&rsquo; asked Maude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody knows, miss!&rsquo;&nbsp; It was characteristic
of Maude that she was so gentle in her bearing that every one
always took it for granted that she was Miss.&nbsp; Frank
examined the writing carefully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was the son of the house and a young aristocrat who
had never done a stroke of work before in his life,&rsquo; said
he.</p>
<p>The matron was surprised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What makes you say that, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What would a workman do with such a name as John Harbel
Knowles, or with a diamond ring for that matter?&nbsp; And who
would dare to disfigure a window so, if he were not of the
family?&nbsp; And why should he be so proud of his work, unless
work was a new and wondrous thing to him.&nbsp; To paint
<i>part</i> of the windows also sounds like the amateur and not
the workman.&nbsp; So I repeat that it was the first achievement
of the son of the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, indeed, I dare say you are right, though I never
thought of it before,&rsquo; said the matron.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now
this, up here, is Carlyle&rsquo;s own room, in which he slept for
forty-seven years.&nbsp; In the case is a cast of his head taken
after death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was strange and rather ghastly to see a plaster head in
this room where the head of flesh had so often lain.&nbsp; Maude
and Frank stood beside it, and gazed long and silently while the
matron, half-bored and half-sympathetic, waited for them to move
on.&nbsp; It was an aquiline face, very different from any
picture which they had seen, sunken cheeks, an old man&rsquo;s
toothless mouth, a hawk nose, a hollow eye&mdash;the gaunt
timbers of what had once been a goodly house.&nbsp; There was
repose, and something of surprise also, in the
features&mdash;also a very subtle serenity and dignity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The distance from the ear to the forehead is said to be
only equalled by Napoleon and by Gladstone.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
what they <i>say</i>,&rsquo; said the matron, with Scotch
caution.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the face of a noble man when all is said and
done,&rsquo; said Frank.&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe that the true
Thomas Carlyle without the dyspepsia, and the true Jane Welsh
without the nerves, are knowing and loving each other in some
further life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is sweet to think so,&rsquo; cried Maude.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh, I do hope that it is so!&nbsp; How dear death would be
if we could only be certain of that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The matron smiled complacently in the superior wisdom of the
Shorter Catechism.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is neither marriage nor
giving in marriage,&rsquo; said she, shaking her head.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This is the spare bedroom, sir, where Mr. Emerson slept
when he was here.&nbsp; And now if you will step this way I will
show you the study.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the singular room which Carlyle had constructed in the
hopes that he could shut out all the noises of the universe, the
crowing of cocks, and the jingling of a young lady&rsquo;s
five-finger exercise in particular.&nbsp; It had cost him a
hundred odd pounds, and had ended in being unendurably hot in
summer, impossibly cold in winter, and so constructed
acoustically that it reverberated every sound in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; For once even his wild and whirling words
could hardly match the occasion&mdash;not all his <i>kraft
sprachen</i> would be too much.&nbsp; For the rest it was at
least a roomy and lofty apartment, with space for many books, and
for an irritable man to wander to and fro.&nbsp; Prints there
were of many historical notables, and slips of letters and of
memoranda in a long glass case.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is one of his clay pipes,&rsquo; said the
matron.&nbsp; &lsquo;He had them all sent through to him from
Glasgow.&nbsp; And that is the pen with which he wrote
<i>Frederick</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a worn, stubby old quill, much the worse for its
monstrous task.&nbsp; It at least of all quill pens might rest
content with having done its work in the world.&nbsp; Some
charred paper beside it caught Frank&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh look, Maude,&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a
little bit of the burned <i>French Revolution</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I remember.&nbsp; He lent the only copy to a
friend, and it was burned by mistake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a blow!&nbsp; What a frightful blow!&nbsp; And to
think that his first comment to his wife was, &ldquo;Well, Mill,
poor fellow, is very much cut up about this.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
is Carlyle at his best.&nbsp; And here is actually a shred of the
old manuscript.&nbsp; How beautifully he wrote in those
days!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Read this, sir,&rsquo; said the matron.</p>
<p>It was part of a letter from Carlyle to his publisher about
his ruined work.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do not pity me,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;forward me rather as a runner that is tripped but will not
lie there, but run and run again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;See what positive misfortune can do for a man,&rsquo;
said Frank.&nbsp; &lsquo;It raised him to a hero.&nbsp; And yet
he could not stand the test of a crowing cock.&nbsp; How
infinitely complex is the human soul&mdash;how illimitably great
and how pitiably small!&nbsp; Now, if ever I have a study of my
own, this is what I want engraved upon the wall.&nbsp; This alone
is well worth our pilgrimage to Chelsea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a short exclamation which had caught his eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rest!&nbsp; Rest!&nbsp; Shall I not have all eternity
to rest in!&rsquo;&nbsp; That serene plaster face down yonder
gave force to the brave words.&nbsp; Frank copied them down onto
the back of one of Maude&rsquo;s cards.</p>
<p>And now they had finished the rooms, but the matron, catching
a glow from these enthusiastic pilgrims, had yet other things to
show them.&nbsp; There was the back garden.&nbsp; Here was the
green pottery seat upon which the unphilosophic philosopher had
smoked his pipe&mdash;a singularly cold and uncomfortable
perch.&nbsp; And here was where Mrs. Carlyle had tried to build a
tent and to imagine herself in the country.&nbsp; And here was
the famous walnut tree&mdash;or at least the stumpy bole
thereof.&nbsp; And here was where the dog Nero was buried, best
known of small white mongrels.</p>
<p>And last of all there was the subterranean and gloomy kitchen,
in which there had lived that long succession of serving-maids of
whom we gain shadowy glimpses in the <i>Letters</i> and in the
<i>Journal</i>.&nbsp; Poor souls, dwellers in the gloom, working
so hard for others, so bitterly reviled when by chance some
weakness of humanity comes to break, for an instant, the routine
of their constant labour, so limited in their hopes and in their
pleasures, they are of all folk upon this planet those for whom a
man&rsquo;s heart may most justly soften.&nbsp; So said Frank as
he gazed around him in the dark-cornered room.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
never one word of sympathy for them, or of anything save scorn in
all his letters.&nbsp; His pen upholding human dignity, but where
was the dignity of these poor girls for whom he has usually one
bitter line of biography in his notes to his wife&rsquo;s
letters?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the worst thing I have against
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jemima wouldn&rsquo;t have stood it,&rsquo; said
Maude.</p>
<p>It was pleasant to be out in the open air once more, but they
were in the pine groves of Woking before Maude had quite shaken
off the gloom of that dark, ghost-haunted house.&nbsp;
&lsquo;After all, you are only twenty-seven,&rsquo; she remarked
as they walked up from the station.&nbsp; She had a way of
occasionally taking a subject by the middle in that way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What then, dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When Carlyle was only twenty-seven I don&rsquo;t
suppose he knew he was going to do all this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And his wife&mdash;if he were married then&mdash;would
feel as I do to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what guarantee have I that you won&rsquo;t do it
after all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, turn out a second Carlyle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hear me swear!&rsquo; cried Frank, and they turned
laughing into their own little gateway at the Lindens.</p>
<h2><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>THE
LAST NOTE OF THE DUET</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> young married couples may feel
that two is company and three is none, but there comes a little
noisy intruder to break into their sweet intimacy.&nbsp; The
coming of the third is the beginning of a new life for them as
well as for it&mdash;a life which is more useful and more
permanent, but never so concentrated as before.&nbsp; That little
pink thing with the blinking eyes will divert some of the love
and some of the attention, and the very trouble which its coming
has caused will set its mother&rsquo;s heart yearning over
it.&nbsp; Not so the man.&nbsp; Some vague resentment mixes with
his pride of paternity, and his wife&rsquo;s sufferings rankle in
his memory when she has herself forgotten them.&nbsp; His pity,
his fears, his helplessness, and his discomfort, give him a share
in the domestic tragedy.&nbsp; It is not without cause that in
some societies it is the man and not the woman who receives the
condolence and the sympathy.</p>
<p>There came a time when Maude was bad, and there came months
when she was better, and then there were indications that a day
was approaching, the very thought of which was a shadow upon her
husband&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; For her part, with the steadfast,
gentle courage of a woman, she faced the future with a sweet
serenity.&nbsp; But to him it was a nightmare&mdash;an actual
nightmare which brought him up damp and quivering in those gray
hours of the dawn, when dark shadows fall upon the spirit of
man.&nbsp; He had a steady nerve for that which affected himself,
a nerve which would keep him quiet and motionless in a
dentist&rsquo;s chair, but what philosophy or hardihood can steel
one against the pain which those whom we love have to
endure.&nbsp; He fretted and chafed, and always with the absurd
delusion that his fretting and chafing were successfully
concealed.&nbsp; A hundred failures never convince a man how
impossible it is to deceive a woman who loves him.&nbsp; Maude
watched him demurely, and made her plans.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know, dear,&rsquo; said she, one evening,
&lsquo;if you can get a week of your holidays now, I think it
would be a very good thing for you to accept that invitation of
Mr. Mildmay&rsquo;s, and spend a few days in golfing at
Norwich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank stared at her open-eyed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&nbsp; Now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear, now&mdash;at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But <i>now</i> of all times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maude looked at him with that glance of absolute obvious
candour which a woman never uses unless she has intent to
deceive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear&mdash;but only next week.&nbsp; I thought it
would brace you up for&mdash;well, for the week
afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think the week afterwards?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear.&nbsp; It would help me so, if I knew that
you were in your best form.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I</i>!&nbsp; What can it matter what form <i>I</i>
am in.&nbsp; But in any case, it is out of the
question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you could get leave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, easily enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then do go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And leave you at such a time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, you would be back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t be so sure of that.&nbsp; No, Maude, I
should never forgive myself.&nbsp; Such an idea would never enter
my head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But for my sake&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Maude.&nbsp; It is
settled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Master Frank had a heavy foot when he did bring it down, and
his wife recognised a decisive thud this time.&nbsp; With a
curious double current of feeling, she was pleased and
disappointed at the same time, but more pleased than
disappointed, so she kissed the marrer of her plots.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What an obstinate old boy it is!&nbsp; But of course
you know best, and I should much rather have you at home.&nbsp;
As you say, one can never be certain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a conflict of wits the woman may lose a battle, but the
odds are that she will win the campaign.&nbsp; The man dissipates
over many things, while she concentrates upon the one.&nbsp;
Maude had made up her mind absolutely upon one point, and she
meant to attain it.&nbsp; She tried here, she tried there,
through a friend, through her mother, but Frank was still
immovable.&nbsp; The ordeal coming upon herself never disturbed
her for an instant.&nbsp; But the thought that Frank would suffer
was unendurable.&nbsp; She put herself in his place, and realised
what it would be to him if he were in the house at such a
time.&nbsp; With many cunning devices she tried to lure him off,
but still, in his stubborn way, he refused to be misled.&nbsp;
And then suddenly she realised that it was too late.</p>
<p>It was early one morning that the conviction came home to her,
but he, at her side, knew nothing of it.&nbsp; He came up to her
before he left for the City.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have not eaten anything, dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Frank, I am not hungry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps, after you get up&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, dear, I thought of staying in bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What nonsense, dear!&nbsp; I want to keep very quiet
until next week, when I may need all my strength.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear girl, I would gladly give ten years of my life to
have next week past.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silly old boy!&nbsp; But I do think it would be wiser
if I were to keep in bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a little headache.&nbsp; Nothing to speak of,
but just a little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think Dr. Jordan had better give you
something for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think so?&nbsp; Well, just as you like.&nbsp;
You might call as you pass, and tell him to step up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so, upon a false mission, the doctor was summoned to her
side, but found a very real mission waiting for him when he got
there.&nbsp; She had written a note for Frank the moment that he
had left the house, and he found both it and a conspiracy of
silence waiting for him when he returned in the late
afternoon.&nbsp; The note was upon the hall-table, and he eagerly
tore it open.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear boy,&rsquo; said this mendacious epistle,
&lsquo;my head is still rather bad, and Dr. Jordan thought that
it would be wiser if I were to have an undisturbed rest, but I
will send down to you when I feel better.&nbsp; Until then I had
best, perhaps, remain alone.&nbsp; Mr. Harrison sent round to say
that he would come to help you to pot the bulbs, so that will
give you something to do.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t bother about me, for
I only want a little rest.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Maude</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It seemed very unnatural to him to come back and not to hear
the swift rustle of the dress which followed always so quickly
upon the creak of his latch-key that they might have been the
same sound.&nbsp; The hall and dining-room seemed unhomely
without the bright welcoming face.&nbsp; He wandered about in a
discontented fashion upon his tiptoes, and then, looking through
the window, he saw Harrison his neighbour coming up the path with
a straw basket in his hand.&nbsp; He opened the door for him with
his finger upon his lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make a row, Harrison,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;my wife&rsquo;s bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harrison whistled softly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, not that.&nbsp; Only a headache, but she is not
to be disturbed.&nbsp; We expect <i>that</i> next week.&nbsp;
Come in here and smoke a pipe with me.&nbsp; It was very kind of
you to bring the bulbs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going back for some more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait a little.&nbsp; You can go back presently.&nbsp;
Sit down and light your pipe.&nbsp; There is some one moving
about upstairs.&nbsp; It must be that heavy-footed Jemima.&nbsp;
I hope she won&rsquo;t wake Maude up.&nbsp; I suppose one must
expect such attacks at such a time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my wife was just the same.&nbsp; No, thank you,
I&rsquo;ve just had some tea.&nbsp; You look worried,
Crosse.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t take things too hard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t get the thought of next week out of my
head.&nbsp; If anything goes wrong&mdash;well there, what can I
do?&nbsp; I never knew how a man&rsquo;s nerves may be harrowed
before.&nbsp; And she is such a saint, Harrison&mdash;such an
absolutely unselfish saint!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never guess what
she tried to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She knew what it would mean to me&mdash;what it will
mean to me&mdash;to sit here in impotence while she goes through
this horrible business.&nbsp; She guessed in some extraordinary
way what my secret feelings were about it.&nbsp; And she actually
tried to deceive me as to when it was to occur&mdash;tried to get
me out of the house on one pretext or another until it was all
over.&nbsp; That was her plot, and, by Jove, she tried it so
cleverly that she would have managed it if something had not put
me on my guard.&nbsp; She was a little too eager, unnaturally so,
and I saw through her game.&nbsp; But think of it, the absolute
unselfishness of it.&nbsp; To consider <i>me</i> at such a time,
and to face her trouble alone and unsupported in order to make it
easier for me.&nbsp; She wanted me to go to Norwich and play
golf.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must have thought you pretty guileless, Crosse, to
be led away so easily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it was a hopeless attempt to deceive me on such a
point, or to dream for an instant that my instincts would not
tell me when she had need of me.&nbsp; But none the less it was
beautiful and characteristic.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mind my
talking of these things, Harrison?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear chap, it is just what you need.&nbsp; You have
been bottling things up too much.&nbsp; Your health will break
down under it.&nbsp; After all, it is not so serious as all
that.&nbsp; The danger is very much exaggerated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had the experience twice now.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll go to the City some fine morning, and when you come
back the whole thing will be over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed it won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I have made arrangements
at the office, and from the hour that she first seems bad I will
never stir from the house.&nbsp; For all she may say, I know very
well that it gives her strength and courage to feel that I am
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may not know that it is coming on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank laughed incredulously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And you think from your experience, Harrison, that it is
not so very bad after all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no.&nbsp; It soon passes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Soon!&nbsp; What do you mean by soon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jordan was there six hours the first time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God!&nbsp; Six hours!&rsquo;&nbsp; Frank wiped his
forehead.&nbsp; &lsquo;They must have seemed six
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They <i>were</i> rather long.&nbsp; I kept on working
in the garden.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the tip.&nbsp; Keep on doing
something and it helps you along wonderfully.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a good suggestion, Harrison.&nbsp; What a
curious smell there is in the air!&nbsp; Do you notice a sort of
low, sweetish, spirity kind of scent?&nbsp; Well, perhaps
it&rsquo;s my imagination.&nbsp; I dare say that my nerves are a
bit strung up these days.&nbsp; But that is a capital idea of
yours about having some work to do.&nbsp; I should like to work
madly for those hours.&nbsp; Have everything up out of the back
garden and plant it all again in the front.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harrison laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something less heroic,&rsquo; said
he; &lsquo;you could keep all these bulbs, and pot them
then.&nbsp; By the way, I&rsquo;ll go round and get the
others.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t bother about the door.&nbsp; I shall
leave it open, for I won&rsquo;t be five minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll put these in the greenhouse,&rsquo; said
Frank.&nbsp; He took the basket of bulbs and he laid them all out
on the wooden shelf of the tiny conservatory which leaned against
the back of the house.&nbsp; When he came out there was a kitten
making a noise somewhere.&nbsp; It was a low sound, but
persistent, coming in burst after burst.&nbsp; He took the rake
and jabbed with the handle amongst the laurel bushes under their
bedroom window.&nbsp; The beast might waken Maude, and so it was
worth some trouble to dislodge it.&nbsp; He could not see it, but
when he had poked among the bushes and cried &lsquo;Skat!&rsquo;
several times, the crying died away, and he carried his empty
basket into the dining-room.&nbsp; There he lit his pipe again,
and waited for Harrison&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>There was that bothersome kitten again.&nbsp; He could hear it
mewing away somewhere.&nbsp; It did not sound so loud as in the
garden, so perhaps it would not matter.&nbsp; He felt very much
inclined to steal upstairs upon tiptoe and see if Maude were
stirring yet.&nbsp; After all, if Jemima, or whoever it was,
could go clumping about in heavy boots over his head, there was
no fear that he could do any harm.&nbsp; And yet she had said
that she would ring or send word the moment she could see him,
and so perhaps he had better wait where he was.&nbsp; He put his
head out of the window and cried &lsquo;Shoo!&rsquo; into the
laurel bushes several times.&nbsp; Then he sat in the armchair
with his back to the door.&nbsp; Steps came heavily along the
hall, and he saw dimly with the back corner of his eye that some
one was in the doorway carrying something.&nbsp; He thought that
really Harrison might have brought the bulbs in more quietly, and
so he treated him with some coldness, and did not turn round to
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put it in the out-house,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why the out-house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We keep them there.&nbsp; But you can put it under the
sideboard, or in the coal-scuttle, or where you like as long as
you don&rsquo;t make any more noise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, surely, Crosse&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; But Frank
suddenly sprang out of his chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if that infernal kitten isn&rsquo;t
somewhere in the room!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And there when he turned was the grim, kindly face of old
Doctor Jordan facing him.&nbsp; He carried in the crook of his
arm a brown shawl with something round and small muffled up in
it.&nbsp; There was one slit in front, and through this came a
fist about the size of a marble, the thumb doubled under the tiny
fingers, and the whole limb giving circular waves, as if the
owner were cheering lustily at his own successful arrival.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here am I, good people, hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!&rsquo;
cried the waving hand.&nbsp; Then as the slit in the shawl
widened Frank saw that behind the energetic fist there was a huge
open mouth, a little button of a nose, and two eyes which were so
resolutely screwed up that it seemed as if the owner had made a
resolution never under any circumstances to take the least notice
of this new world into which it had been transported.&nbsp; Frank
dropped his pipe and stood staring at this apparition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The baby!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Baby?&nbsp; Whose baby?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your baby, of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My baby!&nbsp; Where&mdash;where did you get
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Jordan burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are like a man who has just been wakened out of his
sleep,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, Crosse, your wife has
been bad all day, but she&rsquo;s all right now, and here&rsquo;s
your son and heir&mdash;a finer lad of the age I never
saw&mdash;fighting weight about seven pounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Frank was a very proud man at the roots of his nature.&nbsp;
He did not readily give himself away.&nbsp; Perhaps if he had
been quite alone he might at that moment, as the great wave of
joy washed through his soul, bearing all his fears and
forebodings away upon its crest, have dropped upon his knees in
prayer.&nbsp; But prayer comes not from the knee but from the
heart, and the whole strength of his nature breathed itself out
in silent thanks to that great Fate which goes its way regardless
either of thanks or reproaches.&nbsp; The doctor saw a pale
self-contained young man before him, and thought him strangely
wanting in emotion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said he, impatiently.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is she
all right?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you take your son?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could she see me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose five minutes would do any
harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Jordan said afterwards that it was three steps which took
Frank up the fifteen stairs.&nbsp; The nurse who met him at the
corner looks back on it as the escape of her lifetime.&nbsp;
Maude lay in bed with a face as pale as the pillow which framed
it.&nbsp; Her lips were bloodless but smiling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frank!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My own dear sweet girlie!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You never knew.&nbsp; Did you, Frank?&nbsp; Tell me
that you never knew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And at that anxious question the foolish pride which keeps the
emotions of the strong man buried down in his soul as though they
were the least honourable part of his nature, fell suddenly to
nothing, and Frank dropped with his head beside the white face
upon the pillow, and lay with his arm across the woman whom he
loved, and sobbed as he had not sobbed since his childhood.&nbsp;
Her cheek was wet with his tears.&nbsp; He never saw the doctor
until he came beside him and touched him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you had better go now,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sorry to be a fool, doctor,&rsquo; said Frank, blushing
hotly in his clumsy English fashion.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s just
more than I can stand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; the doctor answered, &lsquo;I owe you an
apology, for I had done you an injustice.&nbsp; Meanwhile your
son is about to be dressed, and there is hardly room for three
men in one bedroom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Frank went down into the darkening room below, and
mechanically lighting his pipe, he sat with his elbows upon his
knees and stared out into the gathering gloom where one bright
evening star twinkled in a violet sky.&nbsp; The gentle hush of
the gloaming was around him, and some late bird was calling
outside amongst the laurels.&nbsp; Above he heard the shuffling
of feet, the murmur of voices, and then amid it all those thin
glutinous cries, <i>his</i> voice, the voice of this new man with
all a man&rsquo;s possibilities for good and for evil, who had
taken up his dwelling with them.&nbsp; And as he listened to
those cries, a gentle sadness was mixed with his joy, for he felt
that things were now for ever changed&mdash;that whatever sweet
harmonies of life might still be awaiting him, from this hour
onwards, they might form themselves into the subtlest and
loveliest of chords, but it must always be as a trio, and never
as the dear duet of the past.</p>
<h2><a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>THE
TRIO</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Extract from a letter to the
Author from Mrs. Frank Crosse</i>.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">It</span> is very singular that you
should say with such confidence that you know that our baby is a
splendid one, and further on you say that in some ways it differs
from any other baby.&nbsp; It is so true, but neither Frank nor I
can imagine how you knew.&nbsp; We both think it so <i>clever</i>
of you to have found it out.&nbsp; When you write to us, do
please tell us how you discovered it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to tell you something about baby, since you so
kindly ask me, but Frank says there is no use my beginning as
there is only one quire of paper in the house.&nbsp; As a matter
of fact, I shall be quite short, which is not because I have not
plenty to say&mdash;you cannot think what a <i>dear</i> he
is&mdash;but because he may wake up at any moment.&nbsp; After
that happens I can only write with one hand, while I wave a
feather fan with the other, and it is so difficult then to say
exactly what you mean.&nbsp; In any case you know that I have not
the habit of collecting and writing down my ideas, so please
forgive me if this seems a stupid letter.&nbsp; Frank could have
done it splendidly.&nbsp; But he has so many sweet and quite
<i>remarkable</i> ways, that I ought to be able to put some of
them down for you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be easier perhaps if I imagine a day of
him&mdash;and one of his days is very much like another.&nbsp; No
one could ever say that he was irregular in his habits.&nbsp;
First thing in the morning I go over to his cot to see if he is
awake yet&mdash;though, of course, I know that he can&rsquo;t be,
for he always lets us know&mdash;the darling!&nbsp; However, I go
over all the same, and I find everything quiet and nothing
visible of baby, but a tiny, turned-up nose.&nbsp; It is so
exactly Frank&rsquo;s nose, only that his is curved the other
way.&nbsp; Then, as I bend over his cot, there is a small sigh,
such a soft, comfortable sound!&nbsp; Then a sort of earthquake
takes place under the eider down, and a tightly clenched fist
appears and is waved in the air.&nbsp; He has such a pleasant,
cheerful way of waving his fists.&nbsp; Then one eye is half
opened, as if he were looking round to see if it were safe to
open the other one, and then he gives a long, sorrowful wail as
he realises that his bottle is not where he left it when he went
to sleep.&nbsp; In a moment he is in my arms and quite happy
again, playing with the lace round the neck of my pink
dressing-gown.&nbsp; When he finds that his nice warm bath is all
ready for him, he becomes quite jovial, and laughs and chuckles
to himself.&nbsp; Something awfully funny must have happened to
him before ever he came into this world at all, for nothing that
has occurred since could account for the intense expression of
amusement that one can often see in his eyes.&nbsp; When he
laughs, Frank says that he looks like some jolly old clean-shaven
toothless friar&mdash;so chubby and good-humoured.&nbsp; He takes
the greatest interest in everything in the room, watches the
nurse moving about, looks out of the window, and examines my hair
and my dress very critically.&nbsp; He loves to see untidy hair
and a bright tie, or a brooch will often catch his eye, and make
him smile.&nbsp; His smile is the most wonderful thing!&nbsp; As
he lies gazing with his great serious blue eyes, his whole face
suddenly lights up, his mouth turns up at one corner in the most
irresistible way, and his cheeks all go off into dimples.&nbsp;
He looks so sweet and innocent, and at the same time so humorous
and wicked, that his foolish mother wants to laugh at him and to
weep over him at the same time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then comes his bath, and there is a sad display of want
of faith upon his part.&nbsp; He enjoys the process, but he is
convinced that only his own exertions keep him from drowning, so
his little fists are desperately clenched, his legs kick up and
down the whole time, and he watches every movement of mother and
nurse with suspicion.&nbsp; He enjoys being dressed, and smiles
at first, and then he suddenly remembers that he has not had his
breakfast.&nbsp; Then the smiles vanish, the small round face
grows so red and angry, and all covered with little wrinkles, and
there is a dismal wailing&mdash;poor darling!&nbsp; If the bottle
is not instantly forthcoming he will howl loudly, and beat the
air with his fists until he gets it.&nbsp; He <i>does</i> remind
me so of his father sometimes.&nbsp; He is always hunting for his
bottle, and will seize my finger, or a bit of my dress, or
anything, and carry it to his mouth, and when he finds it
isn&rsquo;t what he wants, he throws it away very angrily.&nbsp;
When finally he does get the bottle, he becomes at once the most
contented being in the whole world, and sucks away with such
great long pulls, and such dear little grunts in between.&nbsp;
Then afterwards, a well-washed, well-fed atom, he is ready to
look about him and observe things.&nbsp; I am sure that he has
his father&rsquo;s brains, and that he is storing up all sorts of
impressions and observations for future use, for he notices
<i>everything</i>.&nbsp; I used to think that babies were stupid
and indifferent&mdash;and perhaps other babies are&mdash;but
<i>he</i> is never indifferent.&nbsp; Sometimes he is pleased and
amused, and sometimes angry, and sometimes gravely interested,
but he is always wide awake and taking things in.&nbsp; When I go
into his room, he always looks at my head, and if I have my
garden hat with the flowers, he is so pleased.&nbsp; He much
prefers chiffon to silk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Almost the first thing that struck me when I saw him,
and it strikes me more and more, was, how could any one have got
the idea of original sin?&nbsp; The people who believe in it can
never have looked into a baby&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; I love to watch
them, and sometimes fancy I can see a faint shade of reminiscence
in them, as if he had still some memories of another life, and
could tell me things if he could only speak.&nbsp; One day as I
sat beside his cot&mdash;Oh dear!&nbsp; I hear his Majesty
calling.&nbsp; So sorry!&nbsp; Good-bye.&mdash;Yours very
truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Maude
Crosse</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I have not time to read this over, but I may
say, in case I omitted it before, that he really is a very
remarkable baby.&rsquo;</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
